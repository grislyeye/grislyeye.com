<p><strong>Status:</strong> At Concept</p>

<p>
  Being a teenager on a zero-hour contract is tough, but then you get stuck in a
  remote gas station during a snowstorm. Just as shit starts to get weird.
</p>

<p>
  Can you weather the night, or are you just another casualty of the gig
  economy?
</p>

<p>
  An adventure for
  <a href="https://goblinarchives.itch.io/liminal-horror">Liminal Horror</a> and
  <a href="https://evlyn.itch.io/liminal-high-school">Liminal High School</a>,
  in the genre of gig work horror.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="product">Shift</span> takes place in the
  <strong>Eigenhaus</strong>, a new setting for
  <span class="product">Liminal Horror</span>. You could run an entire campaign
  around the Eigenhaus, and there are more adventures for it coming.
