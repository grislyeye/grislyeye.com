<p><strong>Status:</strong> At Concept</p>

<p>Being a teenager on a zero-hour contract is tough, but then you get stuck in a remote gas station during a snowstorm. Just as shit starts to get weird.</p>

<p>Can you weather the night, or are you just another casualty of the gig economy?</p>

<p>An adventure for <a href="https://goblinarchives.itch.io/liminal-horror">Liminal Horror</a> and <a href="https://evlyn.itch.io/liminal-high-school">Liminal High School</a>, in the genre of gig work horror.
