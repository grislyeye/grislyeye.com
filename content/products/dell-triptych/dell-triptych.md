**Status:** Playtesting

<span class="product">_The Dell Triptych_</span> is a retro [Mage: The Ascension](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Mage:_The_Ascension) campaign of suburban magic, set in 90s London.

### Where the fuck is Adam?

Reality is beginning to unravel in Perivale. Friends are going missing and strange beings prowl the streets. Can your clique of teenage dirtbags and outcast mages get their shit together before chaos is unleashed?

The characters are a cabal of teenage orphans who find themselves caught up in the Ascension War when a new arrival brings the Technocracy to their front door.

<span class="product">_The Dell Triptych_</span> includes:

- An entire campaign set in a suburban sandbox.

- Details on how to play orphan mages, with example templates.
- A glimpse of Awakened London and its mage factions.

### Why the 90s?

As a late Gen-X kid, I never got to run that perfect _Mage_ campaign. This is my attempt to recapture that feverish period of my life, in all its grunge and toxic angst.

What's more, situating <span class="product">_The Dell Triptych_</span> in the nineties avoids most of the complex metaplot of late-stage World of Darkness. Early _Mage: The Ascension_ is a relatively straightforward setting for new players. We have ten iconic splats to choose from and an easy-to-grasp conflict between Traditions and Technocracy.
