<p><span class="product">CONT/EXT</span> is a <span class="title">Mothership</span> one-shot of existential horror. A britpunk nightmare set on the Lachesis: a failing, deep-space research station.</p>

<p>The Lachesis has gone radio silent, and it's up to your crew to investigate why, and recover as much valuable research as possible. (Rescue optional).</p>

<p><strong>Current Status:</strong> In playtest. Cover and writing are done, and I've started on some preliminary design and layout work.</p>
