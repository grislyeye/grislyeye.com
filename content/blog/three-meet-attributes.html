<p>I am reminded of a parable: a pond skater was admiring his pond. <q>Behold, its perfect curves. How plentiful its food. Enough space for pond skater life to prosper, no more, and no less,</q> he proclaimed. Incapable of conceiving the waters below, or the skies above, he remarked: <q>This universe is truly unique and complete!</q></p>

<p>He was then promptly plucked out of the water by a kingfisher. Before being swallowed, he glimpsed the incomprehensible, cosmic horror of a new dimension <em>around</em> the surface of his pond. And beyond? More ponds than any pond skater should, or could, ever imagine.</p>

<p>Which is to say, we all suffer some kind of myopia. The most powerful (and painful) of which is nostalgia.</p>

<h4 id="big-6">The Big 6</h4>

<p>Speaking of myopic nostalgia, let’s talk about the <q>Big 6</q> ability scores: Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.</p>

<p><q>Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence…</q> A holy mantra, repeated by the faithful. A lens through which so much RPG design is viewed.</p>

<p>The stakes are high on the subject of the Big 6. To the OSR movement, they’re an essential fragment of forgotten lore. To Wizard’s of the Coast, a grand legacy that must be honoured. And why fix something that isn’t broken? The Big 6 are a <em>lingua franca</em> for expressing characters. Anyone with a passing familiarity with TTRPGs knows what Dexterity, Wisdom, etc. means.</p>

<p>However, another school of thought holds that that ability scores should reflect the flavour, and core proficiencies of your game. For example, In a science fiction game, Dexterity might not make sense when lasers have replaced bows, and technology reduces the importance of manual finesse.</p>

  <p>This article is part of a series following the design of my low-fantasy 5E hack, <a href="https://grislyeye.github.io/three-meet/">Three Meet</a>. The game is free, and you can read the draft now. If you have any feedback, please post on the <a href="https://github.com/grislyeye/three-meet/discussions">forum</a>.</p>

<h4 id="three-meet">Three Meet</h4>

<p class="preview">With this new school of thought in mind, the motivating design goal for Three Meet is to <strong>unify and simplify the ability scores into three Attributes: Might, Cunning, and Wisdom.</strong></p>

<p>It’s no coincidence these correspond with the core activities of traditional fantasy roleplaying: fighting, thieving, and casting spells. (More on that later.) Players are presented with an abbreviated choice: Might is how fightery you are, Cunning how thiefy, and Wisdom how clericy or wizardy you are.</p>

<p>If you want to play a fierce warrior, you just increase your Might, rather than worrying whether to put your highest scores into Strength or Constitution. Similarly, a wily thief doesn’t have to chose between Dexterity or Perception. Cunning covers both.</p>

<p>And Wisdom and Intelligence are merged into a single score One that that doesn’t require various philosophical contortions to separate. (Are you foolish for smoking? Or merely naive?)</p>

<aside>
  <p>Another common bugbear (CR 1) is that the scores aren’t themselves useful, and only the modifiers are significant. So we’ll be <strong>tracking the modifiers only.</strong></p>
</aside>

<h4 id="summary">What of all this?</h4>

<p>Three Meet trades simplicity for expressiveness. Certainly, characters you could express through the Big 6 are harder to express with Might, Cunning, and Wisdom. The bumbling wizard is a famous example.</p>

<p>Yet not all is lost… skills can shore up these gaps. Perhaps the bumbling wizard has high Wisdom, and proficiency in Arcana/History, but lacks proficiency in Insight.</p>

<p>Will this work? Playtest will tell. What is next? I’ll be looking at the corresponding character classes: The Mighty, The Cunning and The Wise. Please subscribe or follow me for updates.</p>
