<h3>Pact of the Cauldron</h3>

<p>Your patron gives you a magical cauldron of black iron with which you can brew potions. As an action you can use your pact cauldron to give one willing creature you can touch one of the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The creature gains temporary hit points equal to your level + your Charisma modifier. </li>
  <li>You end one condition afflicting the creature. The condition can be paralysed or poisoned.</li>
</ul>

<p>The creature cannot benefit from this feature again until it has finished a short or long rest.</p>

<p>You also use your pact cauldron wherever you might use a herbalism kit or alchemist's supplies. This includes ability checks that require a herbalism kit or alchemist's supplies. When you do so you are considered proficient.</p>

<p>You can transform one magic cauldron into your pact cauldron by performing a special ritual. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.</p>

<p>If you lose your cauldron, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous cauldron. The cauldron turns to slag when you die.</p>

<p>The following Warlock eldritch invocations are specific to the Pact of the Cauldron feature:</p>
