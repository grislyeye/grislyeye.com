**Rating:** ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

*Dolmenwood* from Necrotic Gnome might be the apotheosis of the OSR. It really doesn't get more sandboxy than this. The setting just brims with player agency. There are no quantum ogres lurking in the woods here. No narrative plots waiting to ensnare players in tiresome railroads.

And the whimsy. So much whimsy.

## The Monster Book

Ah, the promise of monster books. I'm a sucker for these things, despite the constant disappointment. Once you've had that first thrill of reading a D&D monster manual, of discovering the weird and wonderful creatures that inhabit Dungeons & Dragons Land, you begin to see a degree of repetition. Each new game system has to include the same old basics: your goblins, orcs, dragons and so forth. Yet, the original monsters fair no better. There are broad categories of monsters that you see in most books: the weird aberrations, the small, vicious pixie-like fairy, insect people, these are just some of the common archetypes you see in most monster books.

So, how does the *Dolmenwood Monster Book* fare?

## End Thoughts

The only problem with *Dolmenwood* that I can think of, is that it might be *too* perfect. Such flawless execution could only be tainted by having player characters coarsely stumble around the titular forest.

Or, perhaps, it's too complete. It defies the DIY aspects of the OSR because, well, there is nothing left to do except play it, leaving the GM twidling his thumbs between sessions. The only ommission I can think of is a lack of mapped dungeons, a problem solved by the suite of adventures published in parallel with the core set.

One might also ask, who is this for? Its steep price (print £94) puts it out of reach of your casual player. It's for the fans, a product of the crowdfunding craze that puts lengthy books in the hands of diehards and collectors. No shade, this will sit on my shelves as testament to my lack of self-control. And why not? It's a work of art, something to be admired, an inspiration.
