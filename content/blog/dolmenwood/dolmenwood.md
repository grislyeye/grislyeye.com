_Dolmenwood_ (Necrotic Gnome, 2025) might be the apotheosis of the OSR. It really doesn't get more sandboxy than this. The setting just brims with player agency. There are no quantum ogres lurking in the woods here. No narrative plots waiting to ensnare players in tiresome railroads.

And the whimsy. So much whimsy.

The only problem _Dolmenwood_ might have it's too perfect. Such flawless execution could only be tainted by having player characters coarsely stumble through its woods

Or, maybe it's too complete. The OSR urge to DIY is confounded because, well, there is nothing left to do except play it, leaving the GM twiddling his thumbs between sessions.

One might also ask, who is this for? Its steep price puts it out of reach of your casual player. It's for the fans, a product of the crowdfunding craze that puts lengthy books in the hands of diehards and collectors. No shade, this will sit on my shelves as testament to my lack of self-control. And why not? It's a work of art, something to be admired and inspired by.
