Last week, my roleplaying table's book club picked *[Linghun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62109191-linghun)* (2023) by Ai Jiang. It's a novella set in a haunted town, that explores themes of grief and home, and how they relate to the lived experiences of immigrants.

I obtained a print-on-demand copy with an attractively haunting cover. Usually, Amazon pod books are of middling quality, but the wide-margined layout worked well with the format.

There was also some debate as to whether *Linghun* was horror or fantasy. I was in the horror camp, but I was in the minority as well.

In the mysterious town of HOME the houses can bring the dead back to their loved ones. However, the ghosts bring social problems with them. For me, this was the real horror, social horror. Scarcity brings despair and neglect:

In HOME, properties are highly desirable, and a grotesque housing market has grown around them, where prospective buyers sit outside houses, homeless, grieving and avidly waiting for the current inhabitants to vacate.

And HOME is a ghost town in more than one way. The addictive qualities of the homes have sucked the life out of its schools and infrastructure. Parents will do anything to see their dead children again, even if it means neglecting their living ones.

I thought *Linghun* started well. The suburban emptiness of the town, and the gentle, meandering plot gave it an eerie, liminal tone. However, the consensus was that it sat awkwardly as a novella. It's either too long or too short, and might've worked better as either a short story or more elaborate novel. As it is, the ending is rushed and has a jarring tonal shift. It just doesn't land.
