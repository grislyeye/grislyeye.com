*[Linghun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62109191-linghun)* (2023) by Ai Jiang was last week's pick for my roleplaying table's book club. It's a novella set in a haunted town, that explores themes of grief and home, and how they relate to the lived experiences of immigrants.

(There was some debate as to whether *Linghun* was horror or fantasy. I was thought it was horror, but I was in the minority.)

In the mysterious town of HOME, the houses can bring the dead back to their loved ones. However, the ghosts bring sickening social problems with them, which for me was the real horror.

In HOME, properties are highly desirable, and a grotesque property market has grown around the homes, where prospective buyers sit outside houses, homeless, grieving and avidly waiting for the current inhabitants to vacate.

And HOME is more than a ghost town in one way. The addictive qualities of the houses has sucked the life out of its schools and infrastructure. Parents will do anything to see their dead children again, even if it means neglecting their living ones.

I thought *Linghun* started well. The suburban emptiness of the town gave it an eerie, liminal tone, and the main characters were rich, developed and sympathetic. However, the consensus was that it sat awkwardly as a novella. It's either too short or too long, and might've worked better either as a short story or a more elaborate novel. As it is, the ending is rushed and makes a somewhat jarring tone shift. It just doesn't land.
