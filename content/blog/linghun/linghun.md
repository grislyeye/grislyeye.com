*[Linghun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62109191-linghun)* (2023) by Ai Jiang was last week's pick for our TTPRG group's book club. It is a novella set in a haunted town that explores themes of grief and home, and how they relate to the lived experiences of immigrants.

(There was some debate amongst us as to whether *Linghun* was horror or fantasy. I was thought it was horror, but I was in the minority.)

*Linghun* is set in the mysterious town of HOME, where the houses can bring the dead back to their loved ones. Obviously, this makes properties highly desirable, which creates a sickening property market where prospective buyers sit outside houses, homeless, grieving and avidly waiting for the current inhabitants to vacate.

I felt - and this was the general consensus - that *Linghun* sat awkwardly as a novella. It's either too short or too long, and might've worked better either as a short story or a more elaborate novel. As it is, the ending is rushed and makes a somewhat jarring tone shift.
