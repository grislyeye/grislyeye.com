</aside>

Last week's book club focussed on [Linghun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62109191-linghun) (2023) by Ai Jiang, a fantasy horror novella about grief and home, and how they relate to the experiences of immigrants.

The book is set in the titular town, where the houses bring the dead back to the living. Obviously, this makes properties highly desirable, which creates a sickening property market where prospective buyers sit outside houses, homeless, grieving and avidly waiting for the current inhabitants to vacate.

I felt - and this was the general consensus - that *Linghun* sits awkwardly as a novella. It's either too short or too long, and might've worked better either as a short story or a more elaborate novel. As it is, the ending is rushed compared to the slow, lingering build up as we explore the town and its desperate inhabitants.
