I've been running _Forbidden Lands_ for a couple of years now and I think I'm at a good place to take stock, reflect on the game, and offer a review from the perspective of a someone who has actually played it.

Let me just say first, for the reasons I outline below, _Forbidden Lands_ is still the best system for games I like to run, despite its flaws. Of course, perspectives may vary, but if you're looking for a simple, skill-based game for low-fantasy, you could do worse.

## Criteria

Criteria:

- Roll-over
- Skills
- Low powered
- 1st-level characters aren’t completely useless
- Simple
- Open licence
- Modifiable
- Setting agnostic
- Non-annoying stats

**Skill based.** I'm a big fan of character skill over player skill, and capturing the fantasy of playing someone who is talented in ways I'm not, and skills are an important part of that fantasy.

**Low powered.** Low fantasy is my passion, and FL satisfies a lot of its tropes: dangerous magic, lethal combat, lasting injury, meaningful options for non-magic characters,

**1st-level characters with agency.**

**Popular.** This is important to me for a number of reasons. I don't just play my games, I write and publish for them too. In particular, I want to write settings and adventures without getting bogged down writing my own games (there are already more than enough). Writing for more popular games ensures that I have an audience, and a wealth of supplementary material to draw from.

**Open Licence.** Following from the above, having an open licence

**Setting agnostic.**

## 1. Simplicity

For me, the main selling point of _Forbidden Lands_ is its simplicity, especially over _Dungeons & Dragons_ and the various 5E variants.

### Dice

At its core _Forbidden Lands_ uses d6 dice-pool mechanic, and I don't know why that matters - I only ever play online, and never roll any physical dice - but it does. I love the idea anyone can print a copy of a game, grab some paper, pencils and handful of d6s, say from an old monopoly set, and run a roleplaying game. It's just aesthetically pleasing. Elegant. Polyhedral dice just get in the way of all that.

Even more so, I love dice pools. There's nothing like the feeling of grabbing a handful of dice, and throwing them together. The more dice you throw, the more likely you'll succeed. Completely intuitive. There's no multiplication, not even addition really: you just count the successes. Frictionless.

Unfortunately, _Forbidden Lands_ also uses polyhedral dice for certain magical effects. I'm pretty sure

### Attributes

The main area of simplicity is with the attributes. One of my pet peeves

This sort of thing borders on the aesthetics of the work (see below for more on that)

## 2. Aesthetics

---

This week things went wrong with the two games I run, on Thursday and Tuesday evenings. On Tuesday my party had a hard choice to make but the rules of _Forbidden Lands_ (in this case the XP mechanic) would more or less punish them for taking a particular decision.

Then on Thursday, a player uncovered a rapier which they, rightly so, wanted to wield themselves. This stumped me, because rapiers aren't stated out in the core rules, and feels like it would make a non-optimal weapon choice if I reskin a broadsword, but more expensive.

The problem I'm facing is that _Forbidden Lands_ is geared towards a Swords and Sorcery exploration style of play, and I'm trying to use it as a more general, fantasy system. And, now that I've been running _Forbidden Lands_ for almost a year now, I think it's time to take stock of the system.

Things I like about _Forbidden Lands_ are:

- ~~d6 based~~
- Attribute damage and critical injuries.
- Simplicity (especially compared to _Dungeons & Dragons_).
- It is easy to modify and hack. I can ignore mechanics without unbalancing the game.
- The simple reputation mechanic pulls above its weight, simulating infamy and acclaim all at once.
- Usage die resources.
- Silver standard.
- Simplicity of coinage.
- Gear dice.
- Encumbrance requires hard choices.
- The social conflict mechanic creates exciting back-and-forth negotiations.
- Combat is punchy.
- The journey mechanics are elegant and fun.
- Magic is dangerous and unpredictable.
- Point-based spell casting.
- All spells scale.
- Boxed set!!!
  - Faux-leather not impressive
  - Hardy books!

Things I dislike:

- ~~The books are very disorganized.~~
  - ~~A lot of the subjects are not ordered alphabetically.~~
  - You have to constantly flip between sections of the book.
- There is a confusing overlap between Empathy and Wits.
- Focuses on the Swords and Sorcery genre.
- Closely tied to setting.
- The game is deceptively complicated, in the following areas in particular:
  - Complicated magic rules.
  - Complicated damage/recovery rules.
  - Artefact die needlessly complicate the system.
- The Pride mechanic is easy to forget.
- Pushing doesn't make sense narratively.
- Players don't feel motivated to push for WP when combat is not the focus.
- Lack of a perception skill.
- Characters advance too quickly.
- The magic disciplines are too flavourful and aren't generic enough.
- Spellcasters can instadeath
  - This can be avoided by safecasting.
- ~~Also requires a bunch of non-d6 dice~~

## The Books Themselves

All of this has been a fairly abstract discussion about the mechanics of the game, but its physical representation is as much, or even more, important. The player's and game master's guides are both beautiful works, but they have one fatal flaw: poor organization,

Why, for example, does Symbolism come before Stone Song in the Magical Disciplines section? Whatever, it doesn't matter. What matters is that I've internalized this arbitrary ordering just so I can navigate the book. I'm sure there's a good reason, but that doesn't matter because it's non-intuitive and get's in the way of reading the damn book.

## Summary

_Forbidden Lands_ is a lot more complex than it seems on a first reading, hampered by disorganized text.

Really, _Forbidden Lands_ is crying out for another revision, even a second edition. You could argue _Dragonbane_ fills that role.
