_Black Griffin_ was our _Dungeons & Dragons_ play-by-chat game that ran every week, from 2017 to 2021.

This an edited log from of our "in-character" chat channel. We've added annotations so you can follow what's going on OOC.

Our party are mercenaries in the employ of the infamous _Company of the Black Griffin_. Lowly even for sellswords, they have been placed on punishment duty as company "fetches": bounty hunters charged with capture of deserters for trial.
