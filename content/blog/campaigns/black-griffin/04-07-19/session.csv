"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:36:00 GMT","Quinn",does,ic,"bows his head."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:36:00 GMT","Quinn",says,ic,"Part of the joy of being without a roof over the head. Tends to blow a man around like a leaf on the wind."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:36:00 GMT","Biron",does,ic,"cooks up the crabs and fish. and squashes the berry into a jam/juice."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:36:00 GMT","Quinn",does,ic,"smiles."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:36:00 GMT","Quinn",says,ic,"Course, now I've found meself a loving family in the Griffon, and no mistake. Blessed I am, for sure."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:37:00 GMT","Orin",says,ic,"I suppose. I hadn't any experience like that until a couple months ago."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:37:00 GMT","Quinn",does,ic,"raises an eyebrow."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:37:00 GMT","Quinn",says,ic,"Found yourself working as lookout for a blind pirate captain a couple of months back?"
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:39:00 GMT","Orin",says,ic,"Er, no... I mean... being on your own, wandering the world and such."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:39:00 GMT","Biron",does,ic,"grumbles."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:39:00 GMT","Biron",says,ic,"Best way to learn."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:39:00 GMT","Orin",does,ic,"clears their throat."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:40:00 GMT","Orin",says,ic,"That's what being in the company is to me, anyway."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:40:00 GMT","Orin",does,ic,"gets up and goes to sit by the shore before waiting for an answer."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:40:00 GMT","Quinn",does,ic,"grins and slaps Orin on the back."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:40:00 GMT","Quinn",says,ic,"Well, ya not on your own none now, ya family, friend! Like it or no!"
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:40:00 GMT","Quinn",does,ic,"sighs as his hand whistles past the departing Orin."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:42:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"The fish broth Biron prepares goes down easier than the seagull. And guards against the chilling night are creeping into the cave. You all feel the warmth of a good meal sitting in your guts as the weariness of your limbs commands attention."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:42:00 GMT","Quinn",does,ic,"lays on his back on the sand, one hand on his full belly and drifts off to sleep."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:42:00 GMT","Orin",does,ic,"shouts to the others:"
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:43:00 GMT","Orin",says,ic,"I'll take first watch."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:43:00 GMT","Orin",does,ic,"turns back to watch the waves."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:43:00 GMT","Biron",does,ic,"looks slightly surprised by this."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:43:00 GMT","Biron",does,ic,"gets lower to the floor and nods."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:43:00 GMT","Biron",says,ic,"I'll take second."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:44:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"Biron seems to fall asleep immediately, as is his manner. Soon followed by a weary Quinn. And so Orin's watch begins."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:44:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"It is roughly midnight when Orin wakes Biron for his watch, nothing untoward other than flocks of birds having troubled their watch."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:44:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"And so, in the pitch of night Biron wakes Quinn for the last watch before falling dead asleep again."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:44:00 GMT","Quinn",does,ic,"grunts and dons his armour then slumps down in the low entryway with his bow over his lap."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:45:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"At first much seems quiet. Gulls screech. The waves crash. It is peaceful, if cold."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:45:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"Then you hear... something."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:45:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"At first Quinn think it is then wind but as the sound gets louder... yes... it is clear... someone whistling a jaunty tune!"
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:45:00 GMT","Quinn",does,ic,"crawls back into the cave and shakes Biron, then Orin."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:45:00 GMT","Quinn",says,ic,"Wake up, someone comes!"
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:47:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"The pair wake with a start, a little weary to be startled at such an hour."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:47:00 GMT","Biron",does,ic,"wakes eyes wide and whips up to a (very tight) crouch position."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:47:00 GMT","Orin",does,ic,"grabs their bow and arrow, sneaking up to the edges of the cave, watching."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:48:00 GMT","Orin",rolls,ooc,"Perception: 20"
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:48:00 GMT","Quinn",rolls,ooc,"Perception: 20"
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:49:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"The tide is still high, but with the little light from the embers of your fire you can see the narrow beach is empty."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:49:00 GMT","Biron",does,ic,"gestures to Orin to pull back a lil."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:49:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"The sound of whistling is getting closer... and higher... it appears to be coming from the cliffs above: someone walking along the coastal path?"
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:49:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"But who would be travelling at this hour?"
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:49:00 GMT","Biron",does,ic,"puts finger to his lips and pulls his shield off his back. presses against the walls of the cave."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:49:00 GMT","Quinn",does,ic,"grins apologetically."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:49:00 GMT","Quinn",says,ic,"Well, sounded like a person, could be the wind whistling through the nooks and crinnies of the cliff some though..."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:49:00 GMT","Quinn",does,ic,"lowers his voice and grins at Biron."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:51:00 GMT","Orin",says,ic,"I'm going to look."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:51:00 GMT","Biron",does,ic,"looks at Quinn and whispers."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:51:00 GMT","Biron",says,ic,"Do you recognise the tune?"
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:51:00 GMT","Quinn",does,ic,"listens intently."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:51:00 GMT","Biron",does,ic,"puts his hand towards Orin."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:51:00 GMT","Orin",does,ic,"crouches, nearly crawling along the cliffside..."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:51:00 GMT","Biron",says,ic,"Let me try. you keep your bow on me."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:52:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"Now that Biron mentions it, it does sound familiar to Quinn. Perhaps a seafaring shanty, though Quinn cannot quite put his finger on which."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:52:00 GMT","Orin",does,ic,"looks at Biron with concern."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:52:00 GMT","Orin",says,ic,"Okay."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:52:00 GMT","Biron",does,ic,"nods to him."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:52:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"You can now see a glow coming from the bluffs above, as though from a lantern."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:52:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"It wavers about in the air, as though the holder is walking ."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:52:00 GMT","Quinn",does,ic,"scratches his head."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:52:00 GMT","Quinn",says,ic,"Sounds a bit like 'the fisherman's daughter'. You know it? It's a bit of a bawdy song, and no mistake. You'd know the chorus - makes it clear that shes the easiest catch some..."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:53:00 GMT","Biron",rolls,ooc,"Stealth: 20"
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:53:00 GMT","Biron",does,ic,"creeps from the cave and up slowly towards the sound."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:53:00 GMT","Quinn",does,ic,"draws his bow and knocks an arrow, squinting to try and keep his eyes on Biron."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:53:00 GMT","Orin",does,ic,"tosses sand on the fire's coals."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:55:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"Biron cautiously climbs the rocks leading back up to the path, quickly and quietly for a man of his size."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:55:00 GMT","Biron",does,ic,"stays low and stays close to the rock face."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:56:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"Coming along the coastal path you spy what appears to be a man wearing a tricorn hat. He carries a lantern hanging from the end of a long pole."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:56:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"However, it is not him whistling!!"
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:56:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"Upon his shoulder sits a black crow, whistling a tune like any human might."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:56:00 GMT","Biron",does,ic,"crouches low to the ground and behind some rocks and bushes and keeps an eye on them."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:58:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"As he approaches you can see the man is clearly much enjoying his stroll. He swings his arm and steps forward as though without a care in the world, in tune to the crow's whistling."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:58:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"A nasty looking mace hangs from his belt, but then who wouldn't carry a weapon in such a remote spot as this?"
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 20:58:00 GMT","Biron",does,ic,"looks for any tattoos, symbols or markings on the stranger or his weapons."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 21:00:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"Nothing else untoward. He bears leather armour, and a coat that has seen better days. Its pockets jangle, perhaps with coin?"
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 21:00:00 GMT","Biron",does,ic,"lays in waits. Looks down back to Orin to see how far away they are."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 21:04:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"The man with the tricorn hat continues to pass by without a fuss, the whistling and light dimming into the distance."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 21:04:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"Biron waits a while before he moves... but not before he catches a glimpse of something else moving down the path: four large folks, brandishing maces follow close behind, with obvious ill intent!"
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 21:04:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"They do not appear to have seen you, but are following the man along the path."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 21:04:00 GMT","Biron",does,ic,"stays silent and watches."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 21:07:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"The four men pass by, treading softly and carefully after the man with the crow."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 21:07:00 GMT","GM",says,ic,"They soon disappear into the night as well."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 21:07:00 GMT","Biron",does,ic,"moves back to the cave."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 21:07:00 GMT","Quinn",does,ic,"looks to Biron."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 21:07:00 GMT","Quinn",says,ic,"Anything of import?"
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 21:07:00 GMT","Biron",does,ic,"grunts,"
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 21:07:00 GMT","Biron",says,ic,"Nothin we need worry about."
"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 21:07:00 GMT","Orin",does,ic,"furrows their brow at Biron."
