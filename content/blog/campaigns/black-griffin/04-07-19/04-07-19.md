This is the second campaign diary for my 5th Edition D&amp;D playtest campaign, <span class="product">Black Griffin</span>. Black Griffin is a play-by-chat game that runs every week on Roll20. The party are mercenaries in the employ of the infamous Company of the Black Griffin. Lowly even for sellswords, they have been placed on punishment duty as company "fetches": bounty hunters charged with capture of deserters for trial.

The below is an edited log from of our <q>in-character</q> chat channel. We've added annotations so you can follow what's going on OOC.

Please enjoy!
