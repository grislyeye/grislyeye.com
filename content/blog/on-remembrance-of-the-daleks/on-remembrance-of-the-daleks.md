I don't really understand why they didn't do this before but the BBC have put the entire 50 year [*Doctor Who* back catalogue](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p0ggwr8l/doctor-who-19631996) on *iPlayer* (UK only). Feels like we (the British public, that is) already paid for it and should have been able to watch it whenever we want but, whatever, I took the bait and looked up some of my favourite episodes.

[_Remembrance of the Daleks_](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p00v91lj/doctor-who-19631996-season-25-remembrance-of-the-daleks-part-1) was the three episode capstone of the 7th Doctor's stint. Everyone has their Doctor and mine was, for all his faults, Sylvester McCoy. He probably isn't well liked in fan circles, what with the show being cancelled under his watch, but I'll always have a fondness for his soft brogue and mischievous smile.

And, it goes without saying, each generation of the Doctor gets at least one Dalek chapter, and _Remembrance_ hits hard for a number of reasons I'll outline below.

## Credits

For me, the _Doctor Who_ credits are a critical part of the show, and they took a sharp turn with the 7th Doctor. Gone were the prog rock synth and 70s special effects. The new theme music is distinctly techno, the effects cutting-edge (for the time) CGI. Gone are the psychedelic discos lights. In with a brooding palette of police blue and angry, violet emissions, all set over a pitch backdrop.

This is not your dad's _Doctor Who_.

It seems strange to think about late-80s _Doctor Who_ as cool. We're talking about a (by that time) obscure British science fiction series with a distinctly middle-class audience. (Look no further than Ace's _Blue Peter_ badges). You have to understand, it was a less cynical time trying hard to be cynical. The endless cycle of gritty reboots had only just got started, and it seemed they'd never get stale. It felt like a fresh start for _Doctor Who_, but it turned out to spell its end.

### Hi Vis Bar

My eye is drawn to that royal blue bar with custard yellow text, dividing the episode title from the writer credit. It features in the end credits as well. Supersaturated colours with some 8-bit dithering, like cheap-and-cheerful plastic mouldings or screeching ZX Spectrum graphics.

I think it's the same font they used for end credits and props on _Red Dwarf_ (Eurostile Extended Bold, FYI). Reminiscent of high visibility industrial safety warnings.

It hints at a forgotten future, a future we imagined we could reach with a bit of BP engineering or Sinclair ingenuity. A future where space is a job, not an aspiration. All the bits were there, it was just a matter of firing a North Sea oil rig into space.

It's the _Nostromo_. It's a chicken vindaloo vending machine.

It's space fascists rolling around the east-end.

## Don’t Mention the War

It always comes back to Coal Hill School. Every _Doctor Who_ showrunner ends up polishing the brass on that sacred touchstone. And why not? If the show's to stay relevant, it needs to be reinvented every now and then.

So we’re back in 60s East London, haunting ground of the First Doctor but, this time, we’re addressing the elephant in the room: resurgent British Nationalism.

There’s a real sympathy between the grey bricks of post-war London, and the oppressive menace of the Daleks. We have fascist cyborgs joining forces with the useful idiots of the British Nationalist movement. We have the delightful symmetry between the warring Imperial and Renegade Dalek factions. (Eventually, the fascists always come knocking for the brown shirts.)

But, if the Imperial Daleks are the flip side to the Renegade Daleks, who is the flip side to the British Nationalists?

On an unrelated note, the Doctor is seen gadding about with the post-colonialist forces of a nascent UNIT. A military force seemingly happy to wave guns around a heavily populated residential area. The Doctor never picks up a weapon himself, of course, but he’s quite happy for others to do the shooting for him.

## It's a *Police* Box

I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again, the Doctor is a cop. We get a hint of this (unintentionally) in _Remembrance_ when the Doctor notes that even Daleks wouldn’t dare interfere with the time stream. Do we detect a note of grudging respect?

<aside>

I mean, even *Loki* addressed this, and that's coming from within the confines of neutered Disney politics.

</aside>

You see, we’re always told messing about with the timeline is dangerous… unless it’s the Doctor doing it. In which case, it’s just sensible (temporal) politics. Leave it to the grown-ups. Just as with the neoliberal consensus, better things are not possible. Interfering with the status-quo could only lead to worse outcomes, just as meddling with time by, say, killing Hitler inevitably paves the way for a hypothetical Super Hitler. Ah well, nevertheless and so on.

## Hand of Omega

What can I say about the Hand of Omega? Rewatching *Remembrance* reminds me how much it influenced me. A piece of _stellar_ engineering. That is, something you make fucking stars with. All tidied away in a neat little box. A tool beyond any crude, human tool that has, if not agency, purpose. A tool of such flexibility it can destroy an entire solar system at one stroke, or gently brush a simple baseball bat with the tiniest sliver of its power and turn it into a Dalek-breaking sword.

A great, metal sarcophagus (who or what is interred within?). It floats on command, clearly only making a pretence of gravity to save the blushes of the mere humans around it.

It also shares a lot in common with the TARDIS. A semi-intelligent box that hides great power within an otherwise innocent looking shell. Wait, is the Hand of Omega a weaponised TARDIS? It would be pretty on-message with the above. Does it matter now? Not really.

### Chaos Daleks

I don’t think the Hand is ever referenced again in the Doctor Who TV canon, which is a shame. A piece of grimdark worldbuilding erased by Russell T. Davies’ shiny, new “Whoniverse”. The Americans already have enough glossy sci-fi, why couldn't we draw from the rich tradition of distinctively grubby British dystopia, instead? And I can’t think of a better vehicle for that than Doctor Who. Certainly, the 7th Doctor was heading in that direction before it got cancelled.

## Special Weapons

Teenage Ric lost his shit when they rolled out the special weapons Dalek, in all its post-industrial glory. Probably old hat these days but, at the time, the form and function of Daleks hadn’t changed much. Now, every season reinvents the Daleks, but back then it was noteworthy.

You see, it hints at more: if there’s a special weapons Dalek, what other special types of Dalek might there be? Have we merely glimpsed the start of a new (brow sweats) list of special Daleks, of which the special weapons _might not even be the coolest?_

## Learnings

_Remembrance of the Daleks_ ends with the total genocide of the Dalek home world. Gone in a not unpleasant special effect. The Doctor has eliminated the Dalek threat (and presumably the lives of billions of other inhabitants of Skaro) without getting his hands dirty. He did warn them, after all, and everyone disappears into the TARDIS for a nice cup of tea. Ah well, nevertheless.

What did we learn? Well, I cringed at some of the special effects and dubious acting, but was thrilled to see Daleks blasting at each other across familiar London streets.

_Remembrance_ plays off the contrast between drab locale and high-concept science fiction to great effect. We have comprehensive school girls possessed by alien ghosts. Mr Bronson from _Grange Hill_ working as a secret Dalek quisling. Floating weapons of mass destruction hiding in old lockups. And racist mums.

The Daleks fight each other as much through their human proxies as they do directly, which lends an air of quiet desperation. Men, women and children (and I'm counting the Doctor's allies in this) drafted into horrifying alien agendas they can't possibly satisfy.

It all works to ground the high concept elements. I'm not going to say it makes it any more believable but, for the author of this article, it certainly offers some interesting alternatives to the aspirational elements of contemporary science fiction, in setting, tone and characters.

But what I recalled most was a distinctly British brand of science fiction, dubious and workmanlike, mostly forgotten, populated with toffs, chancers, thugs and other, grubby sorts.
