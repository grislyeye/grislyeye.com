<p>Halfway decent rules for mass combat is the holy grail for D&amp;D. Our upcoming monograph, <span class="product">The Many</span>, will use the rules for swarms from the <span class="product">Monster Manual</span> to simulate battles. This has several advantages over other mass combat systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Simplicity.</strong> Re-uses the familiar rules for combat.</li>
  <li><strong>Agency.</strong> Individual characters can still affect the outcome of a battle.</li>
  <li><strong>Awesomeness.</strong> Powerful characters can feel awesome by going toe-to-toe with whole armies.</li>
  <li><strong>Mooks.</strong> Re-introduces the concept of minions from 4th Edition <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Many</strong> will introduce new stat blocks for humanoid <q>swarms</q>, or <em>units</em>. The party could face these units in battle, or command them against opposing forces.</p>
