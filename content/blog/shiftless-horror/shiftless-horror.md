This post evolved out of a [self-essay](https://rolltodoubt.wordpress.com/2023/12/23/on-creative-method/) I wrote while developing [CONT/EXT](https://grislyeye.com/products/context/). It turned up some interesting ideas on world design, horror, institutions and British sci-fi, so I present my (incomplete) thoughts here.

</aside>

>The PCs have been recruited by a secretive organisation called Continued Existence (CONT/EXT for short). CONT/EXT’s mission is to ensure humanity can survive an Outside Context Event (OCE), such as a catastrophic solar event. Or, in this case, an encounter with a hostile alien threat.

- _CONT/EXT_, by me.

At the edges of [CONT/EXT](https://grislyeye.com/products/context/) is the institution after which the module is named. What kind of organisation is CONT/EXT, and what is its place in a game like *Mothership*?

## Shiftless

In _Alien_ (1979) the protagonists are not scientists or explorers, they are workers on what is, effectively, a giant piece of industrial machinery, employed as precarious contractors, apathetic to the wonders of space, resentful and perhaps a little bit bored, and who only reluctantly respond to that fateful distress signal.

In my mind the characters from _Alien_ seemed working class but, looking through the cast list, actually a lot of them are officers, of one form or another. Distinctly middle-class occupations.

</aside>

_Alien_ is, of course, the foundational work of _Mothership_, but it is also a uniquely British vision. Produced by Twentieth Century-Fox’s British production subsidiary, filmed in England and the directorial product of Tyneside son, Ridley Scott. It is clearly inspired by Scott's early life growing up in the industrial North.

We see in it the beginning of a distinctly British strain of "shiftless" or "grubby" science fiction that focuses on the less aspirational elements of the genre (which I've [touched on before](/blog/on-remembrance-of-the-daleks/)). In shiftless science fiction space is not a vista for exploration, it's a job, and a dangerous, boring one at that. Research, exploration: these are luxuries of the upper classes.

Similarly, in _Mothership_ we have teamsters and marines, not Jedi knights or astronauts. Our crews begin in debt and are primarily motivated by the need to pay off these dues.

By playing off the elements of high-concept science fiction against the grubby lives of its protagonists, shiftless sci-fi lends an air of social realism and grittiness more suitable to the gloomy outlook of rainy islands sitting at the edge of the grey waters of the Atlantic.

Elements of this "shiftless" or "grubby" science fiction include:

- **Oppressive.** A shiftless universe is full of alien agendas, inhuman forces and the uncaring, physical laws of the universe. Characters are generally victims or proxies of these elements.
- **Working class.** Protagonists tend to be workers, or struggling middle-class at best.
- **Exploitation.** Billionaires dream of reaching space: a limitless void free from physical restrictions and the social forces that bind the rich and protect the vulnerable. The shiftless always keep a cynical eye on such endeavours.
- **Institutional.** All of the above combine into shiftless sci-fi's most common motif: the oppressive institution.

## The Inevitable Horror of British Institutions

>You know the person who had the greatest positive impact on the environment of this planet? Genghis Khan, because he massacred 40 million people. There was no one to farm the land, forests grew back, carbon was dragged out of the atmosphere. And had this monster not existed, there'd be another billion of us today, jostling for space on this dying planet.

- _Utopia_, 2013

The inhumanity of institutions is a running theme in _Mothership_. In this case, the inhuman horror of the faceless corporation, which can be as terrifying as the hostile aliens themselves (_"You don't see them fucking each other over for a goddamn percentage."_). They are terrible for their inevitable, implacable qualities. Weyland-Yutani exists because, well, _someone_ has to monopolise space. Its immensity is too vast for one person to encompass, it can only be controlled by an entity that lives beyond any human span and that can bear the weight of that responsibility regardless of the costs.

In other words, an institution.

We can see hints of implied institutions in the mechanics of _Mothership_. The marine class implies an interstellar military force of some kind, and a military force of that size implies a larger institution whose interests need protecting by force.

Similarly, the working-class teamster implies that our stratified social structure has migrated to space. If teamsters are organised into a profession, who is doing the organising? Who is writing those contracts? Who is holding those debts?

In sci-fi horror, the threat of an institution is threefold:

- **Inevitable.** The true power of institutions is that something like it *must* exist. Its function, whether mining spice or managing colonies, is too vital, too complicated or too long-term for any individual to perform, and so there stands the institution, bearing that load.
- **Utilitarian.** It is ruthless in the pursuit of its goals, unconcerned about the human cost. As alien as any parasitic bioweapon. As unfathomable as the vastness of space.
- **Implacable.** Stemming from its inevitability and ruthlessness is its implacability: it cannot be denied. Its needs and wants eclipse any individual, and all must yield.

That last one is important, because the real horror of the institution is not what it will do to us, the horror is what will it make us do.

In many ways, these institutions mirror the forces of the universe itself. Their structures map onto the vast distances between worlds. Their constraints are the speed of light, the Newtonian limits of mass and acceleration, and the interstellar distribution of elements, as determined by the physics of star formation. These "cold equations" are a running theme in British sci-fi horror, from the ecofascism of _Utopia_ (2013) to the cosmic threat of nuclear annihilation that hangs over Cold War techno-thrillers.

And CONT/EXT is part of that horror: it's inhuman ruthlessness. The existential threats to humanity are terrifying, but so are the strategies for survival. Agents of CONT/EXT expose themselves to bizarre alien infections, sacrifice their lives, just to learn something, anything that might give humanity a slim chance to survive impending annihilation. For what? So they might be the last to die? So that their loved ones might have a chance aboard whatever fateful lifeboat CONT/EXT might scramble together?

### A survey of fictional British institutions

<aside>

You might note that _Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy_ and _James Bond_ aren't strictly sci-fi. I won't do a deep dive into what is and isn't science fiction, except to note that there is some crossover with spy fiction.

</aside>

Examples of notable, fictional institutions from British science fiction that come to mind include:

- The Village from _The Prisoner_.
- The Circus (MI6) from _Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy_.
- UNIT from _Doctor Who_.
- The British Experimental Rocket Group from _Quatermass_.
- MI6 from _James Bond_.
- Special Circumstances from the *Culture* Novels.

We can see they share the following elements:

- **Eccentricity.** A notable tolerance of peculiarity.
- **Unorthodox.** They reward unconventional thinking.
- **Privileged.** In the public school, classically educated sense (evidenced by the ubiquity of characters speaking in cut-glass, English accents).
- **Exclusive.** Secret organisations are selective by their nature but, of course, British organisations are selective on class.
- **Secretive.** As opposed to secret (more on this below).
- **Post-War.** WW2 seemed to have been an incubator for intelligence organisations and new sciences, and many of the above organisations are all products of war.

Then, there are these qualities, which are common but not ubiquitous:

- **Military.**
- **Ex-Colonial.** Military personnel tend to be remnants of demobbed colonial postings.
- **Science-led.** The institutions tend to post scientists in prominent roles.
- **Comfortable.** Of course, anything related to the British upper-class prioritises comfort, whether that is tea ladies or the luxurious, wood-panelled interiors of gentlemen's clubs.
- **Parsimonious.** Conversely, British institutions often run under tight budgets, especially in the post-war period.
- **State-sponsored.** From chartered companies like the East India Company to British Petroleum, even private institutions are often proxies for state interests.
- **Hierarchical.** Institutions tend to inculcate an obsession with status and rank due to their closed nature.

### Colonialism

Of course, British sci-fi and _Mothership_ horror is threaded with colonialism. Look no further than the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. Its ubiquity and orientalism is reminiscent of chartered companies from the "Age of Exploration," such as the East Indian Company. It seems unchallenged in space, a monolith that is at once government _and_ business endeavour, just like the company states that ravaged "the colonies".

### Secretive

British institutions seem to be secretive rather than actually secret (in the conspiracy sense). Rather, they abhor scrutiny. This oppressive quality of presence felt but untouchable - inaccessible to those without privilege - is what characterises them.

It's very different from a secret society, which abhors observation altogether. A secretive British institution doesn't need to be secret itself. Its privileged position isolates it from the disadvantages an exposed secret organisation might face.

Perhaps this explains the preponderance of secret societies across the Atlantic: discovery would make them vulnerable to the will of USA democratic checks and balances, so better to remain unseen. No privilege to protect them there, so the thinking goes.

## Learnings

This article was research for [CONT/EXT](https://grislyeye.com/products/context), my upcoming britpunk one-shot for Mothership. Please follow or [subscribe](/mailing-list/) for updates.

</aside>

What have we learned and what can we apply to _CONT/EXT_ and, more broadly, to a more British interpretation of _Mothership_?

Some closing thoughts:

* **Secretive.** CONT/EXT is a conspiracy, but why would it need to operate in secrecy? Total secrecy implies a lot about the setting: primarily that publicity could hamper its operations, which in turn implies that there are public institutions that could do something to stop it. But why would there be? Perhaps CONT/EXT is better as a more oppressive organisation that works in public, perhaps a proxy to state control.
* **Shiftless.** The adventure is set on _The Lachesis_, a deep space research station studying an alien superstructure but, as we discussed above, scientific research is a bit too aspirational for our tone. I might consider changing the setting to something more workmanlike, perhaps an installation extracting material from the superstructure.
* **Post-Crisis.** If many British organisations are products of the war, perhaps CONT/EXT is a product of some prior catastrophe? It would make sense. Our establishments are reactionary, and might only collaborate in the aftermath of some near brush with extinction.
* **Parsimonious.** *CONT/EXT* already has a cheap and cheerful flavour, with its 80s blue and orange colour palette, and lo-fi tech. Working for humanity's survival, but on a tight budget. It's already on-theme.
* **Eccentricity** is a key part of British fiction, but we need to treat it carefully here in case it undercuts the horror.

I've got some thinking to do and some edits to make.
