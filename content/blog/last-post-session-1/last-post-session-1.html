<p class="preview">This is the first campaign diary for my 5th Edition campaign, <span class=title>The Last Post</span>. Heavily influenced by Gary Gygax's famous <span class=product>B2 Keep on the Borderlands</span>.</p>

<p>The Last Post is a play-by-chat game that runs every week on Roll20. The party are venturing forth from the forbidding Keep, into the untamed wilderness of the Western Hinterlands.</p>

<p>The below is an edited log from of our <q>in-character</q> chat channel. We've added annotations so you can follow what's going on. Please enjoy!</p>

  <h4>Arrival at the Keep</h4>

  <p>It is with some relief that the party spy the Keep rising between the hills that border the Western Hinterlands. It perches on a rocky outcrop. Ivy chokes its high walls, vibrant green against its grey stones.</p>

  <p>Within its walls a pile of gables, chimney stacks, and towers huddle together. They rise in a steep incline to a forbidding fortress.</p>

  <p>A stone bridge ascends to a gatehouse, spanning a treacherous ravine.</p>

    <dt>Flint</dt>
    <dd class=action>looks up at the giant walls..quickly checking his seeming in a little mirror he keeps on his person.</dd>

    <dt>Alic</dt>
    <dd>
      <p><span class=action>hobbles up to the bridge. short and scruffy. Limping on his left leg. Grumbling terribly</span></p>
      <p> By father.. stoopid... pissin' poxy leg... cobbles everywhere... stupid walk this is.</p>

  <aside>
    <p>The campaign takes place in the Western Hinterlands, a heavily-forested wilderness that sits at the western edge of the Low Kingdoms. Ages ago the kingdoms of the Hinterlands, lead by the ancient lords and ladies of House Brer, fell to the chaos creeping from the west.</p>

    <p>Once abandoned, the Keep has been reclaimed by the lords and ladies of the Low Kingdoms as a foothold into the Western Hinterlands.</p>

    <p>Chris (he/him) says <q><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/35315219">Alic</a> (he/him) is my character, a grumpy old man with a busted leg and small man syndrome.</q></p>

    <p>Liam (he/him) says <q><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/35319744">Flint Barkfrost</a> (he/him) is my character, an exiled fairy knight. He is magically disguised as a mortal.</q></p>

    <p>Morgan (they/them) says <q><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/DuTempete/characters/35315221">Strik</a> (they/them) is my character, a mysterious Hinterland native. Wild-looking and mouldy.</q></p>

  <aside>
    <p>Liam says, <q>Do you all already have factions?</q></p>
    <p>Morgan says, <q>Not me, no.</q></p>
    <p>Chris says, <q>I don't think I have. I was leaning towards the darker side of the Mercies.</q></p>

    <p class="break"></p>

    <p><span class="title">The Last Post</span> makes heavy use of the rules for player factions in chapter 1 of the <span class="product">Dungeon Master's Guide</span>.</p>

    <p>These are summarised as follows:</p>

    <p><strong>Merciful Company of the Cerulean Swords (Mercies).</strong> This infamous company of mercenaries has been exiled for a crime (they claim) they didn't commit. They bide their time accepting any old contract in the vain hope they can one day restore their tattered reputation.</p>

    <p><strong>Royal Society of Magic.</strong>The magicians of the Society are permitted to practice magic on the condition they govern its use. They keep a wary eye on <q>hedge</q> practitioners and capture or kill those who use ruinous magic.</p>

    <p><strong>Thieves' Council.</strong> Knaves, blackguards and scoundrels might escape the law, but few can escape the Thieves' Council. All criminals must pay the council's tithe or face the consequences. Even in the Hinterlands.</p>

    <p><strong>Wardens of the West.</strong> A century ago the wardens vanished. Now they have returned to preserve the Old God's claim to the Hinterlands. They guide those who travel through the wilderness and watch for threats to the natural order.</p>
  </aside>

  <p>The party make their way across the steep bridge. With the sun directly above them, its flagstones blaze with heat.</p>

  <p>The gatehouse here stands over the ravine. A crow's cage hangs from the outside walls containing a corpse, blackened by decay. The rushing of water can be heard far below.</p>

  <p>Beneath a precipitous drop falls beneath the gate house. Beyond, another stone bridge spans the rest of the gulf to the Keep itself.</p>

  <p>A solitary guard slouches here, sweat covering his brow. He stands up as the party approach, a hard look on his face. Behind him the gates stand firmly shut.</p>

    <p>Liam says, <q>Okay I haven't told the group but Flint is here because he's heard the magic society will sometimes protect magical creatures... It's a rumour he doesn't know how truthful it is.</q></p>

  <aside>
    <p>While the gods remain silent, their faithful are anything but. The Low Kingdoms are filled with acolytes, priests and zealots of <strong>The Holy Temple</strong>. They stand on city streets scolding the masses, or wander lonely roads looking for converts.</p>

    <p>The Temple is the all-powerful instrument of the New Gods, the Mother and the Father. It is a massive institution that crosses national boundaries and has its fingers in nearly every aspect of common life. No other faiths are tolerated, and even kings must bend their knee to the Hierophant.</p>

    <dd>Thank you for all your help.</dd>

    <dd>You are wise, ser.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>The party make their way across the second bridge, into the Keep itself.</p>

  <p>As they approach they hear screaming, shouting and booing. They find themselves in a small square where all, wooden stake stands.</p>

  <p>A platform has been constructed at the base of the post. A chopping block stained with blood sits atop.</p>

  <p>An execution appears to be taking place. A crowd of peasants has assembled and are booing as a burly executioner drags a monk onto the platform.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>The monk</dt>
    <dd>PLEASE, HAVE MERCY ON ME.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>A barrel chested man with a bushy, black beard and a bald pate appears to be supervising. He wears an eye-patch covering a nasty looking scar.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Alic</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class=action>looks up with a grim smile,</p>
      <p>Friend o' yers?</p>

    <dt>Strik</dt>
    <dd>What gives you that idea?</dd>

    <dt>Alic</dt>
    <dd>Notin'. Notin' at all.</dd>

    <dt>The monk</dt>
    <dd>PLEASE, SPARE ME.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The executioner drags the monk kneeling in front of the chopping block.</p>

  <p>The burly officer nods, and turns to the crowd, waiting for the shouting and booing so subside.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Gyles</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>On this day, the first of Summer, I, Lieutenant Gyles, Commander of the Bailiff, do hereby sentence this man for the crime of heresy.</p>
      <p class=action>points to a sign that hangs from the post.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <aside>
    Seeking to subjugate the forces harrowing their borders, the nobles of the Low Kingdoms have stationed a skeleton force here, under the command of Countess Erys of House Graye. She cares not what happens within the Keep, provided her laws are not broken.
  </aside>

  <p>The sign reads as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>
      <p>By the order of the Castellan of the Keep, Countess Erys of House Graye, the laws are as follows:</p>

      <p>
        Pay the Tax<br>
        No Killing<br>
        No Stealing<br>
        No Adultery<br>
        No Witchcraft</p>
    </em>
  </blockquote>

  <dl>
    <dt>Gyles</dt>
    <dd>This post has stood for centuries, as does the the law of the Low Kingdoms. The rules are few, but the punishment is the same.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The crowd roar at this, chanting <q>Chop him, chop him!</q></p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Gyles</dt>
    <dd>Can anyone speak in the defence of this apostate?</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The crowd boos.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Gyles</dt>
    <dd class=action>nods to the executioner.</dd>

    <dt>The monk</dt>
    <dd>NO, HAVE MERCY, BY THE MO....</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>There is a loud crack. A heavy thud, and the monk speaks no more. A loud cheer goes up.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Alic</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class=action>shouts up with the crowd.</p>
      <p>Kill 'im.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>With the excitement over, the crowd start to disperse, happily chatting amongst themselves.</p>

  <p>The Command of Bailiff marches off, while the executioner starts to pick up the pieces of the monk.</p>

  <p>This gives you time to examine your surroundings.</p>

  <p>To the south is a stables.</p>

  <p>A cobbled street runes westwards.</p>

  <p>And to the north a crooked, three story building leans awkwardly. A sign outside proudly declares it is The Last Post.</p>

  <p>To be continued...</p>
