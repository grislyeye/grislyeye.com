  Damage. It is at the heart of rules for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Hit
  points are god. This is an excerpt from my forthcoming monograph,
  <span class="product">The Harrowed</span> that expands on the variant rules
  for sanity, madness and lingering injuries in Chapter 9 of the
  <span class="product">Dungeon Master's Guide</span>.
</p>

<p>
  They are inspired by my favourite computer game, Darkest Dungeon. If you
  haven't played it, check it out. The rules for stress are particularly well
  thought out, adding an additional time pressure to complete adventures.
</p>

<h3>Variant: Stress</h3>

<p>
  This variant is for gritty or low fantasy campaigns where adventuring life is
  not just hard on the body, but risks sanity as well.
</p>

<p>
  When you encounter a stressful event you must make a Charisma saving throw or
  suffer psychic damage. If you fail your saving throw by 5 or less you also
  become Frightened for 1 minute. The DC and amount of damage depends on the
  difficulty of the stress: whether it is <em>disturbing</em>,
  <em>shocking</em>, <em>horrifying</em> or <em>monstrous</em> as per the
  Stressful Events table.
</p>

<p>
  In low fantasy campaigns, where monsters (at least the non-human kind) are
  rare or legendary, encountering such creatures could be also a stressful
  event. See the following table:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="number">CR</th>
      <th>Stress Difficulty</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="number">0-4</td>
      <td>Disturbing</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="number">5-10</td>
      <td>Shocking</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="number">11-15</td>
      <td>Horrifying</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="number">16+</td>
      <td>Monstrous</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  You get advantage on the Charisma saving throw if you have encountered this
  type of magical creature before. If you fail your saving throw by 5 or less
  you also become Frightened for 1 minute.

<h3>Variant: Lingering Psychic Injuries</h3>

<p>
  This variant gives an additional table for lingering injuries for psychic
  damage. Continue to roll on the old Lingering Injuries table for non-psychic
  damage.
