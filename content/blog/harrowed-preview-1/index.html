<p>Damage. It is at the heart of rules for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Hit points are god. This is an excerpt from my forthcoming monograph, <span class="product">The Harrowed</span> that expands on the variant rules for sanity, madness and lingering injuries in Chapter 9 of the <span class="product">Dungeon Master's Guide</span>.</p>

<p>They are inspired by my favourite computer game, Darkest Dungeon. If you haven't played it, check it out. The rules for stress are particularly well thought out, adding an additional time pressure to complete adventures.</p>

<h3>Variant: Stress</h3>

<p>This variant is for gritty or low fantasy campaigns where adventuring life is not just hard on the body, but risks sanity as well.</p>

<p>When you encounter a stressful event you must make a Charisma saving throw or suffer psychic damage. If you fail your saving throw by 5 or less you also become Frightened for 1 minute. The DC and amount of damage depends on the difficulty of the stress: whether it is <em>disturbing</em>, <em>shocking</em>, <em>horrifying</em> or <em>monstrous</em> as per the Stressful Events table.</p>

<p>In low fantasy campaigns, where monsters (at least the non-human kind) are rare or legendary, encountering such creatures could be also a stressful event. See the following table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="number">CR</th>
      <th>Stress Difficulty</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="number">0-4</td>
      <td>Disturbing</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="number">5-10</td>
      <td>Shocking</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="number">11-15</td>
      <td>Horrifying</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="number">16+</td>
      <td>Monstrous</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You get advantage on the Charisma saving throw if you have encountered this type of magical creature before. If you fail your saving throw by 5 or less you also become Frightened for 1 minute.</p>

<h3>Variant: Lingering Psychic Injuries</h3>
