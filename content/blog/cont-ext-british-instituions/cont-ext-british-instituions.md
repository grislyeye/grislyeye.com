>The PCs have been recruited by a secretive organisation called Continued Existence (CONT/EXT for short). CONT/EXTâ€™s mission is to ensure humanity can survive an Outside Context Event (OCE), such as a catastrophic solar event. Or, in this case, an encounter with a hostile alien threat.

- Ric Wood, [CONT/EXT](https://grislyeye.com/products/context/).

<aside>

This post evolved out of a [self-essay](https://rolltodoubt.wordpress.com/2023/12/23/on-creative-method/) I wrote while developing [CONT/EXT](https://grislyeye.com/products/context/). It turned up some interesting ideas on world design, so I present my (incomplete) thoughts here.

</aside>

At the edges of _CONT/EXT_ is the titular institution itself. What kind of organisation is CONT/EXT and how does it reinforce the britpunk themes and aesthetics of the adventure? And what is its place in a game like <span class="product">Mothership</span>?

So began a personal interrogation on the nature of secret intelligence agencies, secret societies and British institutions. Because, first and foremost, CONT/EXT has the quality of an institution. It is established, its goals are long-term and its privileges exclusive.

Furthermore, I feel it's necessary to interrogate my unconscious American assumptions when it comes to British secret services. CONT/EXT is a secret society in the tradition of American paranoid politics, but are conspiracy theories uniquely American? And what are the differences between American and British institutions?

## Horror and conspiracy

CONT/EXT itself is part of the horror of the adventure: it's secrecy and it's inhuman ruthlessness. The existential threats to humanity are terrifying, but so are the strategies for survival.

## A survey of fictional British institutions

Examples of notable, fictional institutions from British science fiction that come to mind include:

<aside>

You might note that _Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy_ and _James Bond_ aren't strictly science fiction. I won't do a deep dive into what is and isn't science fiction, except to note that there is some crossover with spy fiction and science fiction, especially when it comes to _James Bond_.

</aside>

- The Village from _The Prisoner_.
- The Circus (MI6) from _Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy_.
- UNIT from _Doctor Who_.
- The British Experimental Rocket Group from _Quatermass_.
- MI6 from _James Bond_.
- Special Circumstances from the *Culture* Novels.

We can see they share the following elements:

- **Eccentricity.** A notable tolerance of peculiarity.
- **Unorthodox.** They reward unconventional thinking.
- **Privileged.** In the public school, classical education sense (evidenced by the ubiquity of characters speaking in cut glass English accents).
- **Exclusive.** Of course, secret organisations are selective, but British organisations are selective on *class*.
- **Secretive.** As opposed to secret (more on this below).

Then, there are these qualities, which are common but no ubiquitous.

- **Military.**
- **Post-War.** WW2 seemed to have been an incubator for intelligence organisations, and many of the above organisations are all products of war.
- **Ex-Colonial.** Military personal tend to be remnants of demobbed colonial postings.
- **Science-led.** The institutions tend to post scientists in prominent roles and rely on [[Secret technology]] to keep an edge over adversaries.
- **Comfortable.** Of course, anything related to the British upper-class prioritises comfort, whether that is access to lashings of English tea, or luxurious, wood-panelled interiors of gentlemen's clubs.
- **Parsimonious.** Conversely, British institutions are always run under tight budgets, especially in the post-war period.

### Secretive

British institutions seem to be secretive rather than actually secret (in the secret society sense). Their presence is felt but they abhor scrutiny. This oppressive quality of presence felt but unobserved or untouched, inaccessible to those without privilege, is what characterises them. It's very different from a secret society, which abhors observation altogether. A secretive British institution doesn't need to be secret itself. Its privileged position isolates it from the disadvantages exposed secret organisations might face.

<aside>

In my mind the characters from _Alien_ seemed working class but, looking through the cast list, actually a lot of them are officers of one form or another. Distinctly middle-class occupations.

</aside>

## Aspiration

One of the things I'm exploring is the difference between [[Aspirational science fiction]]. A lot of science fiction comes with

I'm discounting far future organisations like Special Circumstances from the Culture Novels because they represent [[Aspirational science fiction]], which is something I'm trying avoid for this work.

- Defensive
- Working class
- Exploitation

## Learnings

You might have noticed, and even been a little irritated, by my obsession with class, but no work of British fiction

There are a number of things in the current draft of _CONT/EXT_ that smack of Americanism:

- Men in black suits.
- European names (i.e. Victor).
- Elements of [[Aspirational science fiction]] (scientific research of alien life).
