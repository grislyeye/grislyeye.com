> An example of the use of wisdom can be given by noting that while the intelligent character will know that smoking is harmful to him, he may well lack the wisdom to stop (this writer may well fall into this category).

- _Dungeon Master's Guide_ by Gary Gygax, 1979

Are you foolish for smoking? Or merely naive? Can you be considered intelligent if you’ll stand in the rain until you catch pneumonia? Do you have the faith to realise that you just _don’t_ put tomatoes in fruit salad?

Such are the philosophical contortions required to distinguish Wisdom from Intelligence in _Dungeons & Dragons_, and its various clones. But, does the difference actually matter?

If you look at the old-school ability scores from the perspective of class, then Intelligence is the wizard attribute and Wisdom is the cleric attribute. The higher your Wisdom, the more “clericy” you are.

But that's an artefact of those systems, not a universal definition. The terms are widely defined as synonyms, so I say let's treat them that way and ignore this arbitrary distinction for new games.
