<p>This variant attempts to do away with the problematic tropes of traditional, fantasy races. Instead, "innate" characteristics that were determined by your race are now determined by your folk <em>and</em> background:</p>

<p>A <strong>folk</strong> is a group of peoples united by a common culture. Yet within that culture many exceptions and variations exists. Like a D&amp;D race, a single folk contains multitudes: subcultures, kingdoms, factions, clans, tribes, courts or religious groups.</p>

<p>More important is your <strong>background</strong>. In this variant your background now determines your initial ability score increase. It also bestows a number of proficiencies and utility features that typically replace the utility <q>skill</q> feats, such as the Actor feat. This makes backgrounds receptacles of many of the <q>ribbon</q> or utility features or feats, allowing your to make more strategic choices for your characters, while still customising them.</p>

<p>When creating your character, replace step 1 with choosing a background and a folk for your character. An example background and folk are given below:</p>
