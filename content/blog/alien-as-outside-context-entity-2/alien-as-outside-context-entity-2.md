This post is part 2 of a two-part [self-essay](https://rolltodoubt.wordpress.com/2023/12/23/on-creative-method/) I wrote on the subject of portraying aliens convincingly for games like _Mothership_.

**Note:** you should definitely read [part 1](/blog/alien-as-outside-context-entity) first.

==\[quote from A Deepness in the Sky]==

In _A Deepness in the Sky_, Vernor Vinge imagined intelligent, spider-like aliens, convincingly unlike humans, only to have two of them go for a nice drive in the countryside. Why did he do this?

## Xenopsychological parochialism

[Xenobiological universalism](/blog/alien-as-outside-context-entity/#xenobiological-universalism) is a powerful tool for imagining alternative forms of life, but it often ignores a key factor: psychology. [Star Trek futurism](/blog/alien-as-outside-context-entity/#star-trek-futurism) rears its ugly head again. As discussed, science fiction imagines all kinds of exotic forms of intelligent life, but gives them very human-like concerns and motivations. By avoiding xenobiological parochialism we have stumbled into a new trap, xenopsychological parochialism: the naive idea that intelligent alien life would share some kind of psychological affinity with us. Just as it is unlikely that we'd share a common biology with aliens, it seems even more unlikely we'd share a psychology.

<aside>

Here's more homework, some examples of xenopsychological fiction:

- *Annihilation* by Jeff Vandermeer
- *Echopraxia* by Peter Watts, 2014

</aside>


This is the hardest leap of all: to imagine completely new forms of intelligent psychology, as distinct from human consciousness as the microscopic cheela from _Dragon's Egg_ are from human biology.

That would be something truly fearful.

### Language as Measure of Alienness

>If a lion could speak, we could not understand him.
- _Philosophical Investigations_ by Ludwig Wittgenstein, 1953

[[Language is inseparable from perception]]
[[If an alien could speak, we could not understand it]]
[[If an alien could speak, we might not even know it was talking]]
[[If an alien could speak, why would it]]
[[Aliens already share our world]]
Is the Nostrimo's cat could speak?

An encounter with aliens should not just be a categorisation problem (stones that can think!?) but should be a fundamental language problem. Not only should we not understand what we are seeing, but we should not be able to express that misunderstanding


## Alien, a case study

<aside>

The subsequent revelations about the artificial origins of the xenomorphs (in *Prometheus* and its sequels) offer little comfort. In this new narrative we see that humans and Engineers are doomed to create intelligent life of their own (androids and xenomorphs, respectively) which, in turn, promptly go "peculiar," as Ridley Scott put it, and turn on their creators.

In the case of the android, the call is coming from inside the house. The alien is of our own creation, all the more alien for its uncanny familiarity. In *Mothership*, androids have most of the physical failings of humans, but that is no comfort. Their "cold inhumanity" is baked into the rules. ("Fear saves made by close friendly players are at disadvantage.")

</aside>

Let us put this all together, and examine the seminal outside context entity: the xenomorph from _Alien_ (1979).

Many have spoken at length about its remarkable and utterly alien physiology, but it's psychology? I think it portrays a truly alien for of intelligence, as well.

The xenomorph is not an animal, but it also lacks personhood. It acts with intent, can even outwit the crew of the *Nostromo*, but appears to lack any other imperative than to kill and breed. Certainly, if it spoke we could not understand it, anymore than the lion, but I know which I'd rather be stuck with. We are relatively safe from the lion as long as it is satiated, but the xenomorph clearly transcends any mere predator. It's always hungers, always acts with immediate and deadly hostility. Does it hate us? Hate doesn't really seem to fit, feels too much like transference. But, it's clearly going beyond any survival instinct we would understand. 

It feels like it only intersects with us 

One very much gets the sense that it we are simply getting in the way of whatvever is really motivating it.

Really, it's only intersection with us is the matter of flesh. It needs us for food and procreation, but that feels just like a stopping over point for its true intent, whatever that is.


The appalling logic of the xenomorph lifecycle. It is horrifying because it speaks an undeniable truth

[[Xenomorph lifecycle was logically consistent]]

[[Chestbursters unsettled women of a certain age]]


==Alternative example:==

We can see an example of this outside context encounters with alien life in Jeff Vandermeer's _Annihilation_, although even I think Vandermeer goes too far, his encounters with alien life are not just incomprehensible (==[does he go too far?==])

## The Thread

This article was research for [CONT/EXT](https://grislyeye.com/products/context), my upcoming britpunk one-shot for Mothership. Please follow or [subscribe](/mailing-list/) for updates.

In _CONT/EXT_ the outside context entity is the mysterious, cable-like super-structure referred to as "The Thread."  The Thread is a cable-like structure, 30 km wide, and indefinitely long: a terminus cannot be observed. It is made of an impossible material, that can handle the stresses of a light-years long thread.

I give some hints to the GM about what it is, but for players cannot understand what they're looking at when they see it.
