A little while ago the Discourse focussed on the OSR credentials of AAA game, *Elden Ring*. In particular, people admired the minimalist elements of the worldbuilding. As Jesse Gerroir [summarised](https://twilightdreams.substack.com/p/an-osr-analysis-of-elden-ring):

> Elden Ring really does show how the only thing you really need to run an interesting RPG is a bunch of weird locations for the players to muck  around in. You don’t really need a strong story or clearly defined NPC  characters with complex psychological personalities and backstories.  You’re not writing a novel. 

As GMs, we're constantly berated for worldbuilding. We shouldn't expand on setting elements that characters aren't going to interact with. It's time wasted, unnecessary, and *Elden Ring's* huge success is a vindication of this idea.

This is all very confusing. Sure, all you need is some "weird locations" and *years and years of development, and famously elaborate worldbuilder George R.R. Martin doing your story design*. Simple really.

If *Elden Ring* is anything, it is an example of the merits of elaborate worldbuilding. Those weird locations work because of the depth of the setting, not despite it. Without that depth, they are shallow and lack a consistent tone. Players will notice.

In other words, depth is good, so don't sweat your worldbuilding, and embrace that depth.
