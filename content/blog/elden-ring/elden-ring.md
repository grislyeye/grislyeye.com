A little while ago, the Discourse focussed on the OSR credentials of _Elden Ring_, Namco's wildly popular dark-fantasy CRPG. In particular, people admired the minimalist elements of its sandbox. As Jesse Gerroir [noted](https://twilightdreams.substack.com/p/an-osr-analysis-of-elden-ring):

> Elden Ring really does show how the only thing you really need to run an interesting RPG is a bunch of weird locations for the players to muck around in. You don’t really need a strong story or clearly defined NPC characters with complex psychological personalities and backstories. You’re not writing a novel.

As GMs, we're constantly berated for our worldbuilding. It's time wasted and _Elden Ring's_ huge success is a vindication of this idea, so the argument goes.

Yet, if _Elden Ring_ is anything, it's an example of the merits of worldbuilding. It's a product of years of development and George R.R. Martin's elaborate story design. Those weird locations work because of the depth of the setting, not despite it.

I say, don't sweat your worldbuilding and embrace depth.
