A little while ago, the Discourse focussed on the OSR credentials of AAA game, *Elden Ring*. In particular, people admired the minimalist elements of its worldbuilding. As Jesse Gerroir [noted](https://twilightdreams.substack.com/p/an-osr-analysis-of-elden-ring):

> Elden Ring really does show how the only thing you really need to run an interesting RPG is a bunch of weird locations for the players to muck  around in. You don’t really need a strong story or clearly defined NPC  characters with complex psychological personalities and backstories.  You’re not writing a novel. 

As GMs, we're constantly berated for our worldbuilding. It's time wasted and *Elden Ring's* huge success is a vindication of this idea, so the argument goes.

Yet, if *Elden Ring* is anything, it is an example of the merits of elaborate worldbuilding. It's a product of years of development and George R.R. Martin's elaborate story design. Those weird locations work because of the depth of the setting, not despite it. 

Don't sweat your worldbuilding and embrace depth.
