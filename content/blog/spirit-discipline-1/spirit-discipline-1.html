<p>
  Due to the unpleasant situation surrounding
  <span class="title">Wizards of the Coast</span> and the
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jan/12/dungeons-and-dragons-wizards-of-the-coast-ogl">OGL 1.1</a>, I (like many others) am moving away from
  <span class="product">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span> and 5E. And an alternative
  that does tick all my boxes (low powered, skill-based, well-supported, etc.)
  is <span class="product">Forbidden Lands</span>.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, I can’t help tinkering. One of my players is running a sorcerer
  with some specific spells they’d like to transfer over to
  <span class="product">Forbidden Lands</span>. So, I’ve quickly hacked a new
  magic discipline because I’m such a good GM…
</p>

<h2 id="spirit-discipline">Witchcraft</h2>

<p class="preview">
  Witchcraft deals with worlds unseen. Planes that exist alongside the mortal
  world, yet separate. A witch acts as an intermediary with the strange beings
  that live there: the spirits. Druids and sorcerers practice this discipline,
  but the types of spirits each deals with aren't the same. A druid might commune
  with spirits of nature, or a sorcerer might speak with the
  <em>things</em> that live in the shadows.

    <p>
      You summon unseen spirits that whisper horrifying secrets to your enemies.
      This spell attacks a number of targets equal to the Power Level. It
      inflicts 1 Wits damage on each target. Each Power Level beyond this can be
      used to increase this damage by 1, against 1 target. Armour does not protect
      against this spell. It does not affect monsters.

    </dl>

    <p>
      You cover yourself in the mien of a spirit you are familiar with, perhaps
      a spirit encountered during a Spirit Walk (see below). You might appear as
      a dead person, a dark figure or an animal. Your size, attributes and
      abilities cannot change.

    <p>
      You summon a minor spirit, an insubstantial being from another plane. It
      always obeys your commands and can be used to stealthily observe and
      report back to you. It vanishes after the spell ends, or when you dismiss
      it.

    <p>
      You enter a trance-like state, and find your disembodied spirit wandering
      through the liminal paths of the spirit world, leaving your physical form
      behind. Here you can see and speak to spirits. With a successful
      MANIPULATION check, you might learn something of value, such as secrets
      only the dead might know, or the true name of a fairy.

    <p>
      You cut through the veil between worlds, revealing a horrifying glimpse of
      what lies beyond the mortal realm. The spell inflicts damage to Wits equal
      to the Power Level, to all creature in range. It does not affect monsters.

    <p>
      Time and distance in the spirit realm do not work by the same laws as the
      mortal world. With this spell, you can create a passage to another NEAR
      location, taking a shortcut through the spirit world. For each Power Level
      above 1, you can take one additional CLOSE human-sized creature along with
      you. You can also spend a Power Level to open a door a SHORT distance
      away.

    <p>
      You summon a spirit from the spirit world. Choose the stats of an animal
      from the table on page 126 in the
      <span class="product">Gamemaster’s Guide</span> to represent this spirit.
      You cannot choose an animal with a Strength higher than twice the Power
      Level. This spirit possesses a random demon ability from the random table
      on page 82 in the <span class="product">Gamemaster’s Guide</span>. It
      vanishes after the spell ends, or when you dismiss it. Spirits are usually
      helpful, but they have their own agendas and may not always be so
      inclined.
