<p><strong><q>Thieves' Council</q></strong> is a name you only hear in whispers, if at all. This alliance of blackguards, scoundrels and rogues has disbanded and reformed many times over the centuries. Most believe its just a legend but the word on the street is that it is very much alive.</p>

<p>Yet no one claims membership. The city watch will assure you it cannot exist. And the Council take great pains to ensure its name never reaches the ears of anyone in real authority. Indeed, The Guild (as it is sometimes called) is known exclusively to the common folk, and then only by reputation.</p>

<p>And a fearsome reputation it has. The thief kings and queens are infamous for their violence. They rule their night empires through intimidation and fear. Those who cross them are often the victims of threats and vicious beatings.</p>

<p>The worst offenders simply disappear. Forever.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Fourth Estate.</em></strong> The thief kings and queens pride themselves on being able to act where princes, popes and proctors cannot. Where the stifling rules of lawful society block or impede, the thieves can step in to smooth the way. Most merchants turn to the council when they need to move certain goods across borders. The common folk can often find justice with the thieves when common law fails them.</p>

<p>And the Guild usually obliges... for a price.</p>

<p><strong><em>Uneasy Alliance.</em></strong> The Council is divided into jurisdictions, each ruled by a thief king or queen. Rumours hint that they gather each year to negotiate agreements and iron out differences, so as to keep the peace between thieves. If true, such a meeting would be a true nexus of misrule and evil and a strike here could do a serious blow to the Guild.</p>

<p><strong><em>Law of Tithe.</em></strong> The Council always gets its cut. All members must tithe one tenth (10%) of any ill-gotten gains to their thief king or queen. Failure to do so (and getting caught) often results in a severe beating. No one hears from those who get caught a second time.</p>

<p><strong><em>Thieves' Sign and Mark.</em></strong> Council members can make themselves known to each other by a discreet Thieves Cant hand sign. Council safe houses and hangouts are also marked with a special Thieves' Mark.</p>

<h3>Beliefs and Goals</h3>

<p>While it might seem absurd for criminals to abide by a set of laws, the <q>Thieves Code</q> plays an important role in keeping the peace (somewhat) between thieves. and prevents crime from getting out of hand and attracting the attention of the authorities and irate mobs</p>

<p><strong>The Black Law.</strong> Keep the council&#39;s existence a secret at all costs. (Chaotic)</p>

<p><strong>The White Law.</strong> Abiding by the Thieves Code guarantees respect within and without the council (Lawful)</p>

<p><strong>The Red Law.</strong> When respect fails, the bloody fist works. (Evil)</p>
