<p><em>Arcane faction (secret)</em></p>

<p>The Order of the Magi is an ancient and secret order of wizards dedicated to safeguarding civilisation from the powers of chaos.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Power Behind the Throne.</strong></em> The magi can be found wherever there are men and women of power. They take roles of learning as viziers, advisers, translators, or scholars in the courts of kings, queens, emperors or tyrants. Seemingly innocuous, the magi subtly influence affairs using their position and magical arts.</p>

<p>Where there are no such rulers, or where rulers are weak and chaos threatens to up-heave civilisation, the magi step in. The order secretly attempts to restore order through any means. Secret histories tells of magi organising coups, raising kings from infants and even assassinating old rulers to make way for new.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Long Game.</strong></em> The order's history stretches back centuries, since the First Empire. Perhaps before even that. And some of their plans take years, decades and, in the case of the archmagi, even centuries to come to fruition. In this way the destiny of kingdoms, empires, and even entire worlds, are shaped.</p>

<p><em><strong>Apprentice and Master.</strong></em> It has always been thus: a master takes an apprentice. When the apprentice has mastered the magical arts they in turn take an apprentice. Through this connection the arcane lore of the magi passes down the generations.</p>

<p>Each apprentice is taught to memorise their lineage, from their master, their master's master and so forth right back to the first of the magi, Primus himself. They often attempt to recite it in full when first introducing themselves, much to the dismay of those around them.</p>

<h4>Beliefs and Goals</h4>

<p>Whilst great believers in the law, the men and women of the order do not believe those rules apply to them. Indeed, they have only a few strictures by which they live:</p>

<p><strong><em>The Greater Good.</em></strong> The strong, not the good, must lead for civilisation to survive. (Lawful)</p>

<p><strong><em>Obey Your Master.</em></strong> Obey your master in all things. (Lawful)</p>
