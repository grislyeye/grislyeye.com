When playtesting [Wargod!](/products/wargod), my *Troika!* grubby fantasy hack, one of the main criticisms from my players was the lack of deterministic character creation. My games are as much romantic fantasy as low fantasy, and my player's like to craft their characters to suit. For them, agency is the ability to explore their character relationships.

The **Wages! System** is a compromise between deterministic character creation and grubby realism of random character creation. By focussing on wages earned, it reinforces the themes of social realism. In this system, players must buy their character through careers

Some assumptions about the system:

- People usually have more than one career, representing a need for resourcefulness and the presence of scarcity and precarity in the setting.

## The Wages! System 

Characters now start with **3d6 (take 2 lowest)** silver pennies in **Wages**. During character creation players are now free to move between careers for as long as they have the wages to do so.

When they take a new career, they gain the wages for that career, which they can use to buy further Trappings (or any item for that matter) to fund further career changes.

You cannot take the same career twice.
