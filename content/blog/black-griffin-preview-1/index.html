<p>The Company of the Black Griffin (often just called <q>Griffin Company</q>) is a mercenary army commanded by the ageing Captain Larke. For a century now it has journeyed east, seeking fortune and glory.</p>

<p><strong><em>Mercenaries, Travellers and Misfits.</em></strong> The main body of the Company is composed of traditional, military forces. Here you will find regiments of cavalry and infantry. Over its century-long journey it has gathered (and lost) troops from lands across the world and it has a fairly cosmopolitan mix of peoples.</p>

<p>Captain Larke also likes to keep around <q>specialists</q> for... sensitive missions. Amidst the ranks you&#39;ll also find war witches, spies, burglars and other misfits.</p>

<p><strong><em>United by a Charter.</em></strong> The Company Charter is an ancient document that outlines the bylaws and core mission of the Company, as well as including a lengthy history of its decades-long migration east. Walter the Scribe (and penny-pinching bursar) keeps the Charter updated with it&#39;s current travels. The Charter is a massive collection of notes, torn scraps, scrolls and other miscellany collected over the years, all bound in black leather into a rough tome.</p>

<p><strong><em>Black Griffin Crest.</em></strong> Members of Griffin Company are known by their crest worn on the shoulder and on shields: a rampant, black griffin on a gold background.</p>

<h4>Beliefs and Goals</h4>

<p><strong>For Honour.</strong> Always fight with honour, or at least the appearance of honour (Lawful... ish)</p>

<p><strong>For Gold.</strong> We fight for a reason and that reason is gold! (Neutral)</p>

<h4>Missions</h4>

<p>Typical missions involve:</p>

<p><strong>Deserters Wanted Dead or Alive</strong> Desertion is the worst crime a mercenary can commit. All company members have a mandate to kill or capture deserters if they find them. Black Griffin commanders will frequently send out small parties of <q>fetches</q> (company bounty hunters) to bring them to justice.</p>

<p><strong>New Contracts</strong> Contracts are the lifeblood of the company and characters that get clients to sign them are accorded immense respect.</p>

<p><strong>New Recruits</strong> Hmmmm... actually, recruits are the lifeblood of the company and characters that get new recruits to sign up are accorded immense respect.</p>
