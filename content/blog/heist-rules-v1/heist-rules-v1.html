<p class="preview">These are my (very draft) rules for heists in 5E. Based off the infamous <em>Blades in the Dark</em> roleplaying game, they’re mainly written to avoid lengthy, and painful planning sessions.</p>

<p>Too often, risk-averse players get bogged down in fruitless over-planning. Instead, these rules place them directly in the middle of the action. We assume the party are already prepared, and allow them to retrospectively create plans, on the fly.</p>

<p>There are two parts here: downtime activity to prepare for a heist, without defining exactly what that preparation entails. And then, the actual heist encounter itself, when preparation may pay off.</p>

<h3 id='downtime-activity-heist-preparation'>Downtime Activity: Heist Preparation</h3>

<p>The preparation stage allows the players to accumulate <strong>Preparation Points (PP)</strong> during downtime. These points can be spent later in the actual heist, to retroactively create planned advantages.</p>

<p>Pick a target, and make the appropriate ability check:</p>

<figure>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th><strong>Target</strong></th>
        <th><strong>Ability Check</strong></th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>A location</td>
        <td>Dexterity (Stealth)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>A wilderness region</td>
        <td>Wisdom (Survival)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>An individual</td>
        <td>Dexterity (Stealth)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>A group</td>
        <td>Charisma (Persuasion)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>A city location</td>
        <td>Wisdom (Perception)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<p><strong><em>Resources.</em></strong> Typically, a character needs free movement and money to spend on bribes and other sundries. Depending on the social circle, the funds required are:</p>

<figure>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th><strong>Social</strong></th>
        <th><strong>Spending</strong></th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Poor</td>
        <td>2gp</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Merchants/Guildsmen</td>
        <td>10gp</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Nobles</td>
        <td>50gp</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</figure>

<p><strong><em>Resolution.</em></strong> Make an ability check. For each additional spend equal to the above, add a +1. Roll to determine how many preparation points you have gathered, by consulting the table below:</p>

<figure>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th><strong>Check Total</strong></th>
        <th><strong>Preparation Points</strong></th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1-5</td>
        <td>None</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>6-10</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>11-20</td>
        <td>2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>21+</td>
        <td>3</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</figure>

<p><strong>Complications.</strong> All preparations come with some form of complication. The DM rolls on the table below in secret, only notifying players if appropriate:</p>

<figure>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th><strong>d6</strong></th>
        <th><strong>Complication</strong></th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>Unawares, you uncover a false piece of information. (You lose a Preparation Point, but only discover this when you try to use your last point).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>You offend a contact, who demands an extravagant gift. If not, you have disadvantage on your next Preparation check.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>One of your contacts becomes obsessed with you and won’t leave you alone.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>You attract unwelcome attention from another faction. They will appear unexpectedly in the middle of the heist.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>You uncover a useful piece of information, but only by promising to complete a dangerous task in return. Gain +2 Preparation Points if you complete this task.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>Your unwelcome attentions do go unnoticed. You have disadvantage on your next Preparation check in this location.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>

<h3 id='running-the-heist'>Running the Heist</h3>

<p>The heist runs like any other encounter, with the notable difference that PP can be spent by players to give their characters pre-planned advantages. Advantages created by PPs represent actions taken during Heist Preparation, that remain unspecified until the moment the points are spent.</p>

<p>When a player spends PPs, surprise! They pull a out knife they'd stashed earlier. Or reveal one of the guards was in on it all along.</p>

<p>Some examples on how you can spend PPs are as follows:</p>

<figure>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th><strong>Advantage</strong></th>
        <th><strong>PP Cost</strong></th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Advantage on a roll.</td>
        <td>1 PP</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Ask 1 question about the heist encounter (such as layout of locations, timings of guard patrols, etc.)</td>
        <td>1-3 PP (depending on question)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Uncover stashed equipment.</td>
        <td>1 PP for small item, 2 PP for medium item, 3 PP for large.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>An NPC is revealed to be another character, perhaps a PC or some other ally.</td>
        <td>2 PP</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<h3 id='summary'>Summary</h3>

<p>This is an un-playtested draft for an upcoming session encounter where my players are planning a thorny parley with the local thieves’ guild. Obviously, treachery is guaranteed (on both sides) so, to avoid a prolonged and confusing discussion about what everyone is doing, I’m hoping I can just throw the PCs into the action.</p>

<p>Some thoughts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PP costs are finger-in-air values. Adjust to taste.</li>
  <li>Similarly, the list of advantages PPs can create is probably incomplete.</li>
  <li>These may give players an overwhelming advantage (each player may have to 1-2 PPS, each). Perhaps there needs to be some constraint on spending PPs?</li>
  <li>The preparation downtime activity feels like a fun way to hand-wave over planning. But it could also be just another speed bump.</li>

</ul>

<p>Anyway, let me know what you think in the comments. Joke, there are no comments.</p>
