<p class="preview">
  These are my (very draft) rules for heists in 5E. Based off the infamous
  <em>Blades in the Dark</em> roleplaying game, they’re mainly written to avoid
  lengthy, and painful planning sessions.
</p>

<p>
  Too often, risk-averse players get bogged down in fruitless over-planning.
  Instead, these rules place them directly in the middle of the action. We
  assume the party are already prepared, and allow them to retrospectively
  create plans, on the fly.
</p>

<p>
  There are two parts here: downtime activity to prepare for a heist, without
  defining exactly what that preparation entails. And then, the actual heist
  encounter itself, when preparation may pay off.

  Downtime Activity: Heist Preparation
</h3>

<p>
  The preparation stage allows the players to accumulate
  <strong>Preparation Points (PP)</strong> during downtime. These points can be
  spent later in the actual heist, to retroactively create planned advantages.
</p>

<p>Pick a target, and make the appropriate ability check:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Target</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Ability Check</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>A location</td>
      <td>Dexterity (Stealth)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A wilderness region</td>
      <td>Wisdom (Survival)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>An individual</td>
      <td>Dexterity (Stealth)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A group</td>
      <td>Charisma (Persuasion)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A city location</td>
      <td>Wisdom (Perception)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  <strong><em>Resources.</em></strong> Typically, a character needs free
  movement and money to spend on bribes and other sundries. Depending on the
  social circle, the funds required are:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Social</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Spending</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Poor</td>
      <td>2gp</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Merchants/Guildsmen</td>
      <td>10gp</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Nobles</td>
      <td>50gp</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  <strong><em>Resolution.</em></strong> Make an ability check. For each
  additional spend equal to the above, add a +1. Roll to determine how many
  preparation points you have gathered, by consulting the table below:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Check Total</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Preparation Points</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1-5</td>
      <td>None</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6-10</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>11-20</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>21+</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  <strong>Complications.</strong> All preparations come with some form of
  complication. The DM rolls on the table below in secret, only notifying
  players if appropriate:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>d6</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Complication</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>
        Unawares, you uncover a false piece of information. (You lose a
        Preparation Point, but only discover this when you try to use your last
        point).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>
        You offend a contact, who demands an extravagant gift. If not, you have
        disadvantage on your next Preparation check.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>
        One of your contacts becomes obsessed with you and won’t leave you
        alone.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>
        You attract unwelcome attention from another faction. They will appear
        unexpectedly in the middle of the heist.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>
        You uncover a useful piece of information, but only by promising to
        complete a dangerous task in return. Gain +2 Preparation Points if you
        complete this task.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>
        Your unwelcome attentions do go unnoticed. You have disadvantage on your
        next Preparation check in this location.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="running-the-heist">Running the Heist</h3>

<p>
  The heist runs like any other encounter, with the notable difference that PP
  can be spent by players to give their characters pre-planned advantages.
  Advantages created by PPs represent actions taken during Heist Preparation,
  that remain unspecified until the moment the points are spent.
</p>

<p>
  When a player spends PPs, surprise! They pull a out knife they'd stashed
  earlier. Or reveal one of the guards was in on it all along.
</p>

<p>Some examples on how you can spend PPs are as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Advantage</strong></th>
      <th><strong>PP Cost</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Advantage on a roll.</td>
      <td>1 PP</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Ask 1 question about the heist encounter (such as layout of locations,
        timings of guard patrols, etc.)
      </td>
      <td>1-3 PP (depending on question)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Uncover stashed equipment.</td>
      <td>1 PP for small item, 2 PP for medium item, 3 PP for large.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        An NPC is revealed to be another character, perhaps a PC or some other
        ally.
      </td>
      <td>2 PP</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>
  This is an un-playtested draft for an upcoming session encounter where my
  players are planning a thorny parley with the local thieves’ guild. Obviously,
  treachery is guaranteed (on both sides) so, to avoid a prolonged and confusing
  discussion about what everyone is doing, I’m hoping I can just throw the PCs
  into the action.
</p>

<p>Some thoughts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PP costs are finger-in-air values. Adjust to taste.</li>
  <li>
    Similarly, the list of advantages PPs can create is probably incomplete.
  </li>
  <li>
    These may give players an overwhelming advantage (each player may have to
    1-2 PPS, each). Perhaps there needs to be some constraint on spending PPs?
  </li>
  <li>
    The preparation downtime activity feels like a fun way to hand-wave over
    planning. But it could also be just another speed bump.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Anyway, let me know what you think in the comments. Joke, there are no
  comments.
</p>
