<p class="preview">It's out! My latest monograph, on the theme of grubby fantasy.</p>

<p>With <a href="/products/grim/"><span class="product">The Grim</span></a>, players now have some new options for running non-heroic characters. Characters with their feet firmly stuck in the gutter. Oblivious to the stars above.</p>

<p>Uh, quick explainer: grubby fantasy was a term first coined by the <span class="product">Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</span> design team. All the way back in the 80s.</p>

<p><q>Grubby fantasy</q> never caught on, as a term, but it's relevant to a distinctly British style of play that I love. It's not gritty, so much as wretched. It's not dark, so much as farcical. It's low fantasy, but for losers. A type of genre only a gloomy Brit could come up with. You know, grubby.</p>

<p><span class="product">The Grim</span> aims to support grubbiness with some low-life occupations (like the ne'er-do-well gambler) and some new equipment items of dubious utility. I also added some rules for making the good stuff harder to get hold of (including the new item tag, 'Illegal').</p>

<p>Finally, I've added some new goods and services that allow characters to do without healing magic in a pinch. Like remedies for diseases, or prosthetics for lingering injuries (one of my favourite, variant rules from the DMG).</p>

<p>It also has an amusing, 16th century woodcut of some random guy puking up.</p>
