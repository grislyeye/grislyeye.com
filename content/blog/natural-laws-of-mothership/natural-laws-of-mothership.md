This post evolved out of a series of [self-essays](https://rolltodoubt.wordpress.com/2023/12/23/on-creative-method/) I wrote while developing [CONT/EXT](https://grislyeye.com/products/context/). I present these (incomplete) thoughts here.

I continue to unpick the intestinal knot in our cultural psyche that is _Alien_ (1979). This article expands on Skerple's [Aliens and Alien Design](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/10/aliens-and-alien-design.html) post, focussing on *Aliens as objects of fear* for games like _Mothership_.

Let me start with this: by definition, aliens should be uncategorisable. In the comfort of Skerple's categories, aliens can only replicate the earthbound horrors of slasher flicks and supernatural thrillers. It's a trap to imagine aliens as comprehensible in any conventional sense.

But, how exactly do you go about imagining incomprehensible aliens?

### Star Trek Futurism

![Still of Captain Kirk look shocked from Star Trek](./content/blog/natural-laws-of-mothership/captain-kirk.jpg "Captain Kirk")

Firstly, in order to question our basic assumptions about alien life you need to understand Star Trek futurism. Star Trek futurism is the (often unconscious) bias that the future will be like eponymous (and often nonsense) TV show. It is an optimistic vision of the future as it ought to be, such as with faster-than-light travel and (most relevant here) contact with ubiquitous, intelligent and human-like alien life.

It's a powerful vision, so thoroughly internalised that it colours everything we understand about science, technology and science fiction. If you've ever wondered why earnest young men consistently keep faith with Elon Musk's increasingly unlikely plans to colonise Mars, it's because Star Trek futurism demands someone, anyone must make this first step.

Star Trek futurism also biases our understanding of alien life. Faster-than-light travel only makes sense (if it makes sense at all) when there's something to actually visit. Or someone, such as intelligent alien life that shares some affinity with us, i.e. possesses the ability and desire to communicate, trade, exchange knowledge, etc. with us.

Any concept of intelligent alien life that lacks that affinity gives lie to the idea that space travel is a meaningful endeavour, and so we see the endless forms of human-like aliens with funny foreheads in popular scifi.

But these creatures can never be terrifying because they are too like us. We must abandon Star Trek futurism, give up on the unlikely idea that aliens would possess any affinity with us, and leap, heedless, into the outside context.

## The outside context

So, I propose a new category: Aliens as outside context entity, or the alien as fundamental physiological, psychological, categorical and semantic break with our parochial expectations of what intelligent alien life might look like.

### Xenobiological universalism

>Alien life, however, does not have to respect the educational difficulties posed by naked apes with oversized brains, and can exploit any autocatalytic system to generate complex 'lifeforms' if the environment permits. And the range of environments - and autocatalytic systems - is huge.

- _What Does a Martian Look Like?_ by Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart, 2004

Xenobiological universalism (called xenoscience by its proponents, although I'd question its scientific basis) is another powerful concept, one that has influenced science fiction authors like Philip K. Dick and Greg Bear. At it's heart is the idea that the complex, self-replicating systems that lead to life are not just unique to this planet, but are, in fact, a fundamental property of nature.

In scientific circles, the general consensus is that conditions for biological life on Earth are so narrow, delicate and improbable, it's unlikely they occur elsewhere in the universe. Certainly, there's no physical evidence for alien life, and the prospect is an unlikely one, and *intelligent* alien life an even unlikelier one.

This is, of course, absurd. Open hailing frequencies!

Universalism rejects this hidebound, parochial outlook. Just as the [the pond skater](https://grislyeye.com/blog/three-meet-attributes/) can't imagine existence beyond the two dimensions of its pool, our earthbound perspectives are prejudicing our definition of life. So, universalism seeks to widen our understanding of what life is, and the conditions under which it might evolve.

In particular, it aims its sights on the possible origins of life on Earth, so-called "autocatalytic systems." Quick science lesson, bear with me: [catalysts](https://www.britannica.com/science/catalyst) are molecules that promote the formation of other molecules, without being used up themselves. For example, enzymes are naturally occurring catalysts, and catalytic converters turn carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide indefinitely.

Autocatalysts - molecules that can create themselves without being used up - don't really exist, but collections of chemical reactions that, taken as a whole, can be autocatalytic. DNA and its various helpers are an example of an autocatalytic system, which are capable of self-replication, a key element that allows complexity to defy the second law of thermodynamics, and persist, grow and, hypothetically, evolve into more complex forms.

![Cover of Diaspora by Greg Egan](./content/blog/natural-laws-of-mothership/diaspora.jpg "Diaspora")

Examples of xenoscientific fiction include:

 - *Diaspora* by Greg Egan, 1997 (a personal favourite)
 - _Dragon's Egg_ by Robert L. Forward, 1980
 - _Mission of Gravity_ by Hal Clement, 1951
 - _Ring_ by Stephen Baxter, 1994
 - *Sundiver* by David Brin, 1980

</aside>

Universalism takes this further, imagining that DNA is just one possible example of an autocatalytic system, and that similar kinds of processes could occur under radically different circumstances. If self-replicating DNA could originate from the basic building blocks of organic chemistry, could not other, self-replicating systems form in the complex interactions in, say, silicon-based chemistry, magnetic fields, and so on?

These are "analogous autocatalytic systems," and they're a tool for imagining radically different forms of alien life, from the sun-ghosts of David Brin's _Sun Diver_, who evolved in the magnetic fields of the Sun's chromosphere, to the microscopic cheela from Robert L. Forward's _Dragon's Egg_, who evolved on the surface of a neutron star.

All that is needed is that spark of self-replicating complexity, whether that is exotic, nucleic "molecules" formed by the strong nuclear force, or organic-like, silicon-based chemistries, or, in one particularly colourful example, squids living in machine-like simulations, running off Wang tile mathematics, formed by the interaction of super-large carbohydrate molecules floating on an alien ocean.

Most importantly, xenobiological universalism allows us to imagine aliens that defy categorisation, that exist in contexts completely outside human experience.

Creatures we can truly fear.

### Fateful intersection

The problem with a lot of these analogous autocatalytic systems is that they propose forms of life so alien to us, it's difficult to understand how we might interact with them. From the perspective of *Mothership*, our interest is in those potential points of contact, where exotic alien biologies unhappily intersect with our own. With xenobiological universalism in mind, horrors can lurch out of the darkness from some very unexpected places. We must imagine (or steal from science fiction) new forms of life that somehow hunger for ours.

### Appalling logic

>...it was a perfectly, perfectly reasonable, it seemed to me, that that some organism should incubate within the warmth of another being.

- John Hurt speaking in *[The Beast Within: The Making of Alien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4G1Jg1oJt8)*, 2023

While we stretch the definition of life, we must take care to stretch it only so far. The xenomorph, for example, is horrifying because it is incomprehensible, but also because it speaks to uncomfortable and undeniable truths about biology. It follows a set of rules that make it feel palpable. When creating improbable biologies, there must be some hook that we can grab hold of to at least make a little sense of the situation.

This article was research for [CONT/EXT](https://grislyeye.com/products/context), my upcoming britpunk one-shot for Mothership. Please follow or [subscribe](/mailing-list/) for updates.

I tried to make the alien "xenostoma" from *CONT/EXT* as inexplicable as possible. It doesn't have any sensory organs, no obvious front or back. It has a form of locomotion that has no earthly equivalent, seemingly designed for space.

There's little context for the player's to latch onto, especially as I kept its full form hidden during playtests. It's a hackneyed trick, but the player's imaginations can fill in the gaps with things far more frightening than anything I could write.

The elegance of *Mothership* allows us to portray complex creatures using the light touch of character stats.

But, the truly inexplicable thing about *CONT/EXT* is the Thread. Next week, I'll look at the psychological and semantic implications of aliens as outside context entity.
