This is a piece of world design I've been toying with over the last few years. It's an attempt to create a low fantasy setting that touches on the tropes of traditional fantasy races without requiring the ubiquitous presence of elves, dwarves, etc.

Here I outline a nameless, implied setting where non-humans are the exception. Several human cultures have been designed so that can be used as drop-in replacements for common races in a traditional fantasy setting. The idea being you can ground pre-existing FRP material by doing so, without too much effort.

## Grounding Fantasy

Gary sought to ground his fantasy in order to maintain a "mostly logical" setting and do so by limiting the non-human elements, in this case playable character races. Which begs the question, what does a mostly "logical" fantasy look like?

A better term is perhaps "consistent" or at least internally consistent. When we think about fantasy, we are mostly (there's that word again) imagining a psuedohistorical setting. And when we think about low fantasy, we imagine a world that has the trappings of historical realism and where magical elements merely intrude (indeed, low fantasy is sometimes called intrusion fantasy). Or, to put it simply, where magic is the exception and not the rule.

And we do this because, once you infer the ramifications of ubiquitous magic, psuedohistoricism becomes inconsistent, and inconsistency breaks the world, making it unbelievable and therefore unrelatable. Or so the mostly-logic follows.

Of course, tastes may vary. Modern players have higher fantasy expectations and are happier to hand wave inconsistent magic. And, to be fair, only the lowliest of low fantasies doesn't require some handwaving. Indeed, isn't hand waving what we might call entertainment? Isn't magic the very definition of hand waving? We want to be transported, to slip the grey shackles of mundanity and flee to worlds unfettered by our physical limitations, after all.

Yet, I think there is still an appetite for "grounded" fantasy. Some of us don't feel transported by shining fantasies. We look at the real world and wonder why a world with magic would be any better. It might even be worse. We're not sure, and the question lingers, nagging at our dreams.

In this case, grounded fantasy offers us an escape, but only an escape to certainty. In a lower fantasy, the world is assuredly grubby and cruel, so the question no longer nags. Our most cynical fears are confirmed and extinguished, even if just for a short time.

And that's the somewhat cold entertainment of it all.

And without a doubt, humans, in all their grubbiness and cruelty, ground our fantasy the best.

## The Fantasy Itself

This work was written to the following principles:

- Replace common fantasy races with human cultures (or, as I will call them, "folk")
- That still touch upon the tropes of the originals
- While avoiding bio-essentialism,
- Avoiding racist tropes
- And avoiding appropriating other cultures.

Each folk lists the tropes it seeks to replace. A goblin tribe can be re-interpreted as a band of hidling bandits. A dwarven smith might translate to a holder exile, sharing his highcraft with the common folk.

The various folk are described without judgement. All cultures have their arseholes and all the folk here certainly do. But they aren't defined by them. I've given some examples of both "good" and "bad" factions, but these aren't prescriptive, and you are invited to create your own.

### The Descendants

**Tropes:** high elves, dark elves

They are long gone but, as with all things related to the Ancestors, nothing truly dies. The Ancestors escaped annihilation by disembodying their spirits. Now they return as the descendants: souls reincarnated, cursed to live life after life as mere shadows of their former selves.

Descendants are reborn randomly, scattered among the common folk, isolated, weak and broken. Through their many lives, they have forgotten much, yet their sorcery still eclipses even the greatest wizard of the common age. They jealously horde this knowledge and prefer to live alone, even among their own kind, whom they trust little.

#### The Fourth Schooling

It is said that three descendants have convened for a legendary Fourth Schooling in the city of Laggard. From across the lands sages and students flock, eager to learn at the side of the very Ancestors themselves or, failing that, grab whatever scraps of might fall from their table.

Yet is all as it seems? Some mutter about fool's gold and wonder to themselves how one might tell a true descendant from a mere mummer. Is this actually a Fourth Schooling, or is it just a canny gambit to entrap the gullible and ensnare what arcane knowledge _they_ might have?

<aside>OK, you got me, descendants are a bit magical. I've made peace with it here because it's pretty subtle.</aside>

### Ferandul

How far have the mighty Ancestors fallen that they must partake of the dead to sustain themselves. Ferandul haunts the cemetery in the coastal village of Wolverton, picking delicate folds of decrepit flesh off the bones of the dead. All so that he might escape the circle of reincarnation his kind are trapped in.

As his body rots before his eyes, it gains a new quality that is, if not vitality, a sturdiness as of flesh embalmed. A quality that prolongs, if it does not exactly sustain, a form of life.

Why does he tolerate it? Because of the gift of time. Time for Ferandul to ferret out a fairer kind of immortality. Time to consolidate his power. Time to gather other descendants together. Time for the Ancestors to return once again.

## Holders

**Tropes:** dwarves, duergar, kobolds

Holders are the remnants of the ancient Craft Empires, those who survived the war with the Ancestors by retreating to vast complexes hidden deep in mountains or far underground, called holds. Here, the holders continue to hoard the knowledge of their highcrafts while the rest of the world descends into a dark age.

Holders are highly communal in nature and identify strongly with their hold. All is shared, in particular child-rearing. Holders are considered children of their hold, having no family names, and are known primarily by given names and secondarily by the name of their hold.

As the centuries pass, the holds are starting to wane, falling to war and age. Many holders are forced to leave the comforts of their ancient homes for the lands beyond.

### Clan Obel

For Clan Obel, their hold has become a lightless tomb. These holders dwelled too long in their darkened halls. Their bellies have grown hungry and their hearts cold.

At night, they strike out, ensnaring travellers with their highcraft weapons and dragging them underground so they might steal their food, set them to work in their mines or worse, much much worse. Those few who escape return aged beyond their years.

Tread carefully through the Cradle Mountains.

## Rhots

**Tropes:** ogres, gnolls, trolls, orcs

The war-rhots (or rhots) wear their crimes upon their faces and bodies. Each has killed in cold blood, indulging in bloodshed for its own sake. Each death slowing warping them, turning teeth to tusks, lengthening limbs, turning skin an unpleasant, raw pink colour, or bones swell to gigantic proportions.

For this reason, rhots are abjured by the other folk. At best banished, at worst hunted and killed. Yet, kept at arms length, for theyâ€™re capable of acts other folk might balk at.

Rhots often find a life in the more lawless circumstances. Perhaps hiding their marks and lurking in the underworld of towns or cities. Perhaps selling their skills as mercenaries for warlords and tyrants. Of course, such jobs guarantee an unpleasant end. Perhaps a fitting punishment, for their crimes.

## Hidlings

**Tropes:** fey, gnomes, goblins, halflings, wood elves

For sure, hidlings are real if you've cake for a head or have yet to be weaned. If you're the few who have heard the tales (and you might yet believe them) they are a rare folk who are notable for hiding from the rest of common civilisation. Sometimes they are close, living alongside other folk in secret, and sometimes apart, hiding in the remote or forgotten places that dot the lands.

The stories speak of a rule which defines their existence: no hidling may reveal where they sleep to non-hidling. A simple law, but it's not always clear what this means exactly.

Some hidlings prefer to remain completely hidden, living cautiously so as never to be seen or heard. Others travel far and wide, never tarrying long enough in the same place to become known. A few live otherwise settled lives, only returning to hidden quarters at night.

Hidlings form into tight-knit bands, such as clans, families or small settlements. A few survive through forage, theft or banditry, but most simply get on with their lives, working trades and raising their families.

What all hidlings fear most is having their homes discovered. This usually means displacement, as a new hiding place must be found. For nomadic hidlings, this isn't usually too much of a problem, but for their settled kindred this can be catastrophic. All too often, discovery of a hidling sanctum can lead to murder to silence witnesses.

All hidlings are known to each by their secret cant, a mixture of subtle gestures and signs.

## Summary

On reflection, the above is a little too idiosyncratic for its intended purpose. It certainly has legs, but it's a bit fiddly and _outrÃ©_ in your standard fantasy roleplay game. It might work as a standalone setting, but then it suffers from some blandness. Which is a shame. It emains here to serve as either a lesson or conversational piece for further thought and discussion.
