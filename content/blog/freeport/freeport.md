One day I'm going to write my own high fantasy setting that addresses the issues I have with them, but today is not that day.

*Freeport City of Adventure* is a well regarded, but long out-of-print, example of that rarest of RPG books: the encyclopaedic city gazetteer. There are only a handful of other contenders I can recall (*Ptolus* obviously, but also *World's Largest City* which was published by Alderac Entertainment Group and then promptly forgotten) that step up to the challenge of describing a city down to the individual building, offering the promise of a completely immersive urban setting. Where *you can knock on any door and know who will answer.* Who wouldn't want that? Certainly, the huge success of *Ptolus* tells us, not many.

Freeport is a fairly low fantasy setting, but then it was published before the race inflation of the 4th and 5th editions (no dragonborn or tieflings here) so [[Low-fantasy reskinning|Low skinning]] it shouldn't be too tricky.

The theme of *Freeport* is pirates and swashbuckling adventure, and its all very *Pirates of the Caribbean*. The city itself an island city state, which probably works well for an urban campaign. You're more or less confined to the city sandbox, but you can still jaunt to other locations in a pinch.

[[üè∞ Low Kingdoms/The Low Kingdoms|The Low Kingdoms]] doesn't have geography yet, may never do so because its intended purpose is as overlay to pre-existing settings. But it would make a good location for [[Port Red Sand]] in [[Dismas Remade]].

The population is mostly humans and halflings, with some elves, dwarves, and they're easy enough to reskin as humans. There is Bloodsalt, an orc/goblin ghetto (wouldn't pass a sensitivity reading now) which is more problematic. There isn't an equivalent for a demihuman community in the [[üè∞ Low Kingdoms/The Low Kingdoms|The Low Kingdoms]] (possibly because I was trying to avoid racist tropes). We have goblins, who are a type of fey and are so rare you wouldn't see them in large numbers, and we have [[üè∞ Low Kingdoms/Orcs|Orcs]] who are just a category of outcasts. I suppose the unlikeliness of a community of [[üè∞ Low Kingdoms/Orcs|Orcs]] is interesting enough, so maybe that's what Bloodsalt is: the first orc community. It would match Freeport's outcast theme.

The main villain of any Freeport campaign are the Yig worshipping serpent folk. If I was going to [[Low skin]] Freeport, I'd probably substitute them for the [[Urfolk]] but that feels like I'm missing out on the whole snake theme. But it would make sense that the [[Urfolk|Urmen]] would be driven to the worship of Yig as an act of desperation after the fall of their precious [[Urfolk Empire]].

## Serpentfolk

I don't have a lizardfolk/serpentfolk analogue in the [[üè∞ Low Kingdoms/The Low Kingdoms|The Low Kingdoms]], yet. The closest I got were the [[Misteli]] but I ditched them because they were too Sword & Sorcery. And lizardfolk don't fit into my design principles: [[Mundane playable folk based on domesticated animals]] and [[Creatures based on flora and wild fauna are fey]]. Snakes and lizards aren't domesticated, and there aren't any fey analogues for them. Maybe they're some form of Asian fey, but I'd like to avoid appropriation.

Interestingly, Freeport does have "azhar" which are genie-touched, and genies area sort of Islamic fey/spirit. Maybe the serpentfolk aren't a [[Folk as race]] at all, but primordial spirits, like the giants.

As an aside, I like the idea Low Kingdom lizard/serpent folk are some sort of parallel lineage to humanity, perhaps with their own version of [[The Mother]] (no Father so as to represent their spawn-like nature). Or maybe descending from a yet-to-be-described ur god. A "[[Spawn God]]" perhaps. Like, where did [[The Mother]] and [[The Father]] come from? The [[Temple]] and the various [[Mother Cults]] probably would have it that they are the first and only gods, but, also, maybe they don't. Maybe they're all petrified of the *unthings* that spawned their gods, an ur god of which the gods are merely its masks.

## History

The book starts with the obligatory history section which is, surprisingly, not at all creepy given the Lovecraftian themes of the setting. Serpentfolk are talked about rather matter-of-factly, there are some notes on how they nearly destroyed the world during the events of the adventure that incepted the setting, and that's about as dark and creepy as it gets.

I suppose it wouldn't be particularly low fantasy if there were more than one Lovecraftian horror at work.

Otherwise, all pretty unmemorable, except perhaps to establish Freeport's cutthroat theme.

## Life

Then the obligatory life section. It's pretty predictable, exactly what you might expect life to be like in a Fantasyland pirate city. Feels like there's a better way to communicate this stuff. Some kind of description-by-exception that says something like "imagine a [[Fantasyland]] pirate city, like that, but..." rather than just redundantly describing a Fantasyland pirate city from the ground up. We all grasp the concept of a Fantasyland pirate city, but first we want to know is what is original about your Fantasyland pirate city.

Notable mentions are The Sea Lords Guard and the Office of Dredging. The Sea Lords Guard are the city watch, and are apparently an explicitly men-only organisation, which seems problematic at first, but would then make a perfectly vile enemy faction. They're all in the pocket of the Freeport's benevolent dictator for life, the Sea Lord, so there's lots to hate.

And the Office of Dredging is Freeport's version of the CIA, which is a great name for an spy organisation.

## The Docks

The Docks are unimaginatively called "The Docks". I'm not one to criticise, that's what I called the docks in [[Dismas]], although I did add an additional adjective, [[South Docks]], see much better.

Right off the bat we have the Longshoremen's Union, basically a fantasy stevedore union, who are apparently quite bolshie. I do like a bit of social realism in my fantasy, but then I am an old fashioned Brit in that regard. Still, a "union" is unsatisfyingly anachronistic. Maybe a guild might be more apposite?

There's also a short aside about how the Docks has a serial killer problem, with more than one regularly operating out of the district. Not sure what to do with that information. One serial killer is a thriller, two or three is a black comedy, more than that and it's all getting a bit silly.

Some pieces I'd low skin:

* Brunnor Wallingston is a dwarf running an alchemist sweatshop. I'd probably switch it up: Brunnor (human now, ofc) is a charlatan who traffics in other charlatans, a sweatshop that produces custom remedies for credulous customers, remedies that either don't work or give you the runs.
* The Harbourmaster is a sea elf who cheats on his sea witch wife, which is a bit high fantastical but I do like the idea that sea fey are infiltrating the government of Freeport. It's probably part of some plot to wreck the waterways so they can have their corals to themselves once again.
* The Acrimony (great name) is a pirate ship kept hidden by illusion magic. It only emerges an a good tip, striking fast and leaving no one alive.
* Karl Wine has uncommonly good luck. Not magic, not blessed by the gods, just a bit of good luck for no reason.

Freeport has its own newspaper? Surely there should be a severe punishment for such an overt anachronism? I suppose sailors might be interested in some kind of almanac, with tides and forecasts and what have you. And I suppose, if you were being generous about it, such an almanac might contain pieces of recent news, such as might be relevant to any sea captain looking to avoid trouble. But who would read it? Certainly not the illiterate sailors that make up the population of Freeport.

Lastly, a number of ships that regularly dock are described, of which the Fell Thrust (floating fortress) and the Vengeance Again (abandoned ship that chooses its captains) are noteworthy.

## Scurvytown

Great name, but maybe a bit on the nose. This is the poor district, which is a category that feels wrong. Real [[Cities don't have neat districts organised along strict class lines]] (==uncited==). They are largely poor with small clusters of wealth here and there, but try writing a gazetteer like that.

As you would expect, Scurvytown isn't a nice place and they lather it on thick with purple prose. How bad is Scurvytown? Real bad, just wait till you see just how bad. Fair enough, a bit of social consciousness doesn't go amiss but you need more substance than the "poverty district."

The chapters starts with Dreaming Street, the Freeport red light district which is, again, pretty edgelordy. You have all your major content warnings here: slavery, sexual abuse, torture. It's notable mainly because I doubt *Wizards of the Coast* would ever include sex workers and because a fantasy red light district is kinda cool.

Yet, the name hints at something more. What if the dream of Dreaming Street was a vision of something unnatural? What if the underbelly of Dreaming Street hid more than just trauma triggers? *The King in Yellow* performed as striptease, anyone? Is that anything?

Then the tone lurches completely when we reach the description of Mouth of Hell, Freeport's seedy nightclub. This one has me stumped. What does a nightclub mean in the context of medieval fantasy? Or even early renaissance fantasy? I mean, who is going to this nightclub? We've just reiterated how poor and horrible Freeport is, but are we also supposed to imagine there's enough disposable, middle-class income going around it can support a nightclub? I don't even know if that's the right question to ask, my brain just stops working thinking through the ramifications. This is fantasy, I suppose, so there's nothing ruling out a nightclub *per se*, but I have to assume the people writing Freeport have actually been to a real nightclub, because it sure seems like they haven't.

I don't know, there you go, fantasy nightclub.

We perambulate further around Scurvytown and, while nothing else particularly stands out, it does detail an interesting conflict between the various criminal factions that hold sway over the slum in a way that isn't overtly end-of-the-world, high adventure. Just humans being horrible to each other, with lots of interesting politics involved. Something I could get my teeth into without having to low skin anything.

## Bloodsalt

Bloodsalt is the "savage humanoids" (they even use those scare quotes in the text, so it appears they have some self-awareness about how bad it sounds) district, sort of a slum of slums. Freeport is so bad, its slums have slums! "Badass," so the thinking goes, one assumes.

There's so much wrong with this chapter. At one point they even do a Jamaican accent. I'm at a loss for words. I don't think it's possible to save this chapter with low skinning. Easier just to completely rewrite or ignore it.

## And All the Rest

It feels like they ran out of steam after Bloodsalt. Or maybe I did. I couldn't find much to say about the other district chapters, but, after you've read one district chapter, they really do start to seem the same. They shouldn't, each district should be an interesting and unique creation that can stand on its own, otherwise, you know, *just don't publish it.*

The Eastern District is the district of the precarious middle class (maybe this isn't early renaissance fantasy, but early 18th-century colonialist fantasy, after all). Socially aware, but hardly an inspiring backdrop for an adventure.

The walled Old City is (predictably) the seat of power in Freeport. It has the most pleasing description (cramped, with narrow, twisting roads and choking alleyways, delightful!). The most interesting location here is the Tombs: Freeport's hellish oubliette, a world unto-itself, crawling with monsters, human and otherwise, a dungeon in the truest sense. It's given short shrift, but I think you could get a whole campaign out of the Tombs.

Drac's End (probably the best name of all the districts) sits right up agains the jungle. So far, Freeport has been described as a isolated settlement, but Drac's End reminds us it's a small part of an island, even if it doesn't do much with it. The Woman is the most influential figure here, an amnesiac fortune teller that guides (an appealing idea). There are also some hints of a second, ghostly Freeport that can be reached from this district. Otherwise, it's just more poverty porn.

Fritz Lieber's Lankhmar is one of the great cities of fantasy, but it has to answer for the crime of spawning a thousand "temple districts". Again, were temple districts a thing? Feels like pre-modern religion was a part of people's everyday lives, and places of worship sat right in the middle of where everyone lived. At least that's how London is laid out.

Like the other miscellaneous districts, the Temple District is pretty generic, and this isn't helped by the insistence that the text remain setting neutral and not refer to any specific gods. The standout here being the Temple of the Pirate God, because a pirate god is an interesting conceit, and because its clergy, apparently, dress up as pirates which is actually hilarious.

Argh, I can't read any more of this. Warehouse District? What? No. Skipping forward...

## Underside

What is a fantasy city with its undercity? Things get interesting again, but unfortunately all too brief. Freeport's sewage system has a storied history, and is infested with degenerate serpentfolk and other horrors. The standout here is the Sewer Watch who are responsible for policing the sewers and hunting down the various serpentfolk cults that rear their heads every now and then. It's dirty work and all that, but I can imagine a whole campaign where the players are keeping the sewers clean.

But that's all, there's no map. Sad.

And, thinking about it, a complex sewer system makes an ideal backdrop for a low fantasy campaign. You can run magical elements beneath ground, while preserving [[Obscurity of low magic]], perhaps a new kind of [[Sewer megadungeon]]? In fact, isn't this just what *Ptolus* is?

## The Serpent's Teeth

## In Summation

Freeport disappoints as your standard [[Dungeons & Dragons Land]] fare. It is pretty much what you would expect from any mainstream setting book, maybe with a bit more edge but really nothing more trifling than some innuendo and minor edgelord stuff.

Maybe the problem is that Freeport can decide *when* is supposed to be. It has elements of the medieval, early renaissance, 18th century, and even modern anachronisms like nightclubs. But, there have been many good settings that do the same (Planescape comes to mind, although not so crassly) so that can't be it.

Is it the edgelordism and ham-fisted attempts to engage with race? It's not much of an excuse, but it is a document of its time (is it though? 2015 isn't that long ago). The industry has come a long way since then in terms of sensitivity (although it still has a long way to go). These elements are awful but they're not fundamental aspects of the work. Sure, you shouldn't write seriously about piracy without engaging with slavery, but this is not a serious work.

It is, of course, verbose, yet also curiously incomplete. Major locations are described with a short description, history (which also includes some description), another, longer, description section and, finally, a key figures section (which often repeats stuff from the other sections). Exhausting! Yet, the rest are just given one word summaries, leaving it up to the GM to fill in the gaps. It's the worst of both worlds: too much description for anyone to hold in their head, but also requiring lots of homework to use.
