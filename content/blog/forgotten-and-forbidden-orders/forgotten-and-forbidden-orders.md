</aside>

*Forgotten and Forbidden Orders* is one of the last sourcebooks published for the elaborate *Mage: the Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition* (hereafter refered to as M20) game line. Forbidden Orders details the Disperate Alliance, one of the main factions in M20 that represents those magical practices that do not side with the Traditions in the Ascension War.

I'll discuss this more in another post, but the entire idea of having supplements for M20 seems at odds with the kitchen-sink approach of the core book. This massive tome bills itself as the ultimate guide for Mage, and (for better or worse) delivers on this promise. There are already detailed write-ups of the Crafts in the core book, so why do we need more?

Well, perhaps *Forgotten and Forbidden Orders* is a actually needed. M20 is 10 years old now, and society has moved on since it was first published. Most notably, cultural appropriation has hit mainstream discourseand, of all the factions, the Crafts are most rooted in real-world cultures, so we must tread carefully. Forbidden Orders seems like much needed retrospective to address appropriation by applying sensitivity readings to the Crafts.

Does it work?

The first problem is the concept of the Disperate Alliance itself. The name is an oxymoron. The original point of the Crafts were that they were independent and isolated, a counter to the somewhat monolithic meta-cultures of the Traditions. The idea they have formed an alliance... It's perhaps why a sensitivity reading is so important: of all the factions, they are the most rooted in real-world cultures, so we must tread carefully.

The Crafts have always had an uneasy relationship with Mage. They tend to have a lot of overlap with other factions (the Solificati and the Cult of Ecstacy, for example) or have obscure roots. Revised got rid of them altogether, folding them back into the Traditions, mainly because White Wolf felt (correctly IMHO) that splat creep was giving new players too many options.

As I understand it, Crafts were the invention of Satyros, who thought the Traditions were too monolithic and didn't really match with real world practices of magic. Of course, for anyone outside of occult circles, this probably isn't so important. At the end of the day, Mage is supposed to be a game, not an occultism simulator. I can understand why a believer would want to move it in that direction, but it sacrifices playability and accessibility to new players.

## Ngoma

I really want to like the Ngoma, but I still don't have a firm grip on who they are. An African version of the Order of Hermes? Pracitioners of an ancient African occult tradition, a tradition that inspired the Order of Hermes? Scholars of forgotten knowledge? 

A lot is made of the fact that the Order of Hermes may have stolen and appropriated Ngoma magic, but are the Ngoma doing anything about this? It's not clear, and this vagueness removes any conflict from the Ngoma. And conflict creates hooks, hooks that you can build player characters on. Without a clear agenda, the Ngoma seem rootless.

And that's a problem with the Crafts, and why I feel they should never have been intended as being playable splats. By definition, they stand are outside the Ascenscion War. And, sure, the Technocracy probably regard them as Reality Deviants, but the implication is that the pogrom has been mostly directed at the Traditions. The writeup of the Ngoma barely even mentions the Technocracy. So, what do they stand for? If you're playing a Ngoma mage, what is motivating you? It's all unclear.

What's more, the Ngoma don't have a clear identity. I want to understand what makes a Ngoma mage, what distinguishes them from the other factions, and I'm still non the wiser.

## Hollow Ones

In Revised Edition, the Hollow Ones were retconned as a Craft, but I've always felt they've sat uncomfortably in that category. Hollow Ones were not intended as a Craft. They were Orphans firstly, less an occult practice and more a new type of mage. Magic is broken, and the Hollow Ones are the product of this. They we nihilists who don't really have a consistent paradigm. In fact, the point of the Hollow Ones is that they didn't *have* a paradigm: magic is broken, so nothing matters, least of all learning Enochian or  

Subsequent changes to the Hollow Ones have turned them into the craft of the romantics
