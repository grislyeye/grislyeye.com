It’s difficult to imagine a character that would have a high Constitution and low Strength. Or vice versa. A ten-stone weakling who has a really chipper immune system? A he-man who goes down in one hit?

Constitution is something of an orphan. Most of the Big 6 belong to one character class. Constitution sits awkwardly apart. Conceptually, it goes hand-in-hand with Strength, so it makes sense (for me) to compose them.
