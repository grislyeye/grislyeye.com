> Curseborne is a game about being unapologetic monsters in a world where being monstrous is the least of your worries.

*Onyx Path's* new urban horror game [Curseborne](https://www.curseborne.com/) has brought me to crisis. I'm asking myself questions I don't really want to answer. Like: have I become everything I hate? Am I an awful grognard? Am I *uncool*?

No, that can't be right. It must be those kids at *Onyx Path Publishing* who are wrong. Although, now I think about it, surely many of the people working the levers at OP are in my age cohort? What is *Onyx Path* but an act of nostalgia itself? An attempt to resurrect game lines that died with *White Wolf*. And who would've been playing and then later republishing those original games? Why, the very same sort of Gen Xers I was playing with in the 90s.

Why has *Curseborne* brought me to this crisis? Well, let me first explain what *Curseborne* is. Now that *Paradox* - the rights holders of the *World of Darkness* - are publishing new material, the licenses that allowed OP to publish their own WoD products have expired. This leaves the nice people at OP without an *ahem* IP for their specialist genre; urban horror. So, *Curseborne* is an attempt to replace that IP with an original setting of their own.

Which is why *Curseborne* fills me with apprehension: it is game haunted, if you will, by *Vampire: the Masquerade*, *Mage: the Ascension* and others. It is, essentially, a product of pure nostalgia. A game written with the dubious premise "like the World of Darkness but different." Not that it's an unreasonable objective, but it comes from a place of practicality rather than creativity. *Curseborne* doesn't start with a need and follow through with a game. It starts with a game in the hope it will become a need. It's not cynical, but maybe it's not entirely authentic either.

Of course, authenticity itself is subjective, which is why I hold out hope for *Curseborne*. Can OP thread the needle here? Can lightening strike twice? Can *Curseborne* give the *World of Darkness* a run for its money? Or, better yet, could it be something entirely different; compelling for WoD fans, but bringing its own unique vision to the table?

It occurs to me that this isn't really a review of *Curseborne*, it's a retrospective on the original *World of Darkness* and my complicated feelings about it. That's a little unfair to *Onyx Path* but, you could argue, they put themselves in my sights by setting out to create a New-New World of Darkness, so let's have at it.

</aside>

Maybe, but I have some reservations with *Onyx Publishing* themselves. Their audience seems to consist mostly of hardcore WoD fans who are willing to fork out cash on Kickstarters and expensive print-on-demand editions. (No shade here, I'm one of them.) However, this can lead to derivative and lengthy works filled with tedious lore that lacks much of the inventiveness of the original games, published to feed an insatiable hunger for nostalgic content regardless of quality. Many of these works are impenetrable, obscure and, well, a bit crusty. 

*White Wolf's* real product was always cool. They seemed to be designed and illustrated by people hipper than you and, whether or not that was actually true, that's what brought new players into the games. Urban horror must be, if it is anything, stylish and desirable and *new* and, if it isn't, then you're not really addressing new players.

So, can *Curseborne* be stylish and desirable and *new*?

It's a question that fills me with existential dread because the lingering subtext here, the awful suspicion, is: can *anyone* my age  create something stylish and desirable and new?

**Chapter 1: The World.** The book starts off with a description of the setting, and we are introduced to the concept of the cursed world. In *Curseborne*, the world itself is cursed, an intricate network of curses that feed off each other. It's a nice conceit that gives a good rational for the "our world but darker" trope of urban fantasy.

**Chapter 2: Lineages.** Here is the heart of the matter. Urban horror TTRPGs live or die by their [splats](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Splat#Fatsplats,_secondary_splats,_and_tiers). They introduce the aesthetic, core concepts, themes and motifs.

*Curseborne* splats seem to be adapted from the *Chronicles of Darkness*/*New World of Darkness* convention. There are a fixed set of inherent splats (like the clans from *Vampire: the Requiem*) and an expansive list of secondary splats, that refine the main concepts into more specific character types (like *Vampire: the Requiem* bloodlines). We have the lineages which represent the core, urban horror archetypes: your vampires, werewolves, etc. And each lineage then has 5-6 secondary splats, called "families".

These families work as both social and inherent factions, and there are around 30 of them, which seems like a lot. This is where we can see *Onyx Publishing*'s verboseness coming out. The original WoD books kept splats to a minimum, usually no more than 13 in a core book. This is because splats are supposed to simplify the character creation process. You pick the splat first, and worry about the details later.

There is a reason *White Wolf* had almost completely separate settings for each of their splats, each only tangentially linked to the others and often with contradictory lore, cosmology and play styles. I think this might be the secret ingredient of the original *World of Darkness*: instead of trying to streamline all the monster legends into one mythos and blandifying them, *White Wolf* instead realised that each of the legends has their own core themes and motifs that would be best served by each splat having its own aesthetic and mythos, and not worrying about the contradictions.

*Curseborne* seems to be doing the opposite of this. Each lineage is really a flat splat, with its own set of rules specific to its archetype. Once you've figured out what you want to play, only then can you start to choose a family. It's a daunting choice, and probably a meaningless one for new players. The families have subtle themes that require a bit of reading between the lines. It's not obvious, for example, that the Munificients are supposed to be djinn analogues, and families are a mix of archetypal (like the Chimerae) and original, setting-specific groups (like the ZEDs).

Now, geeks love lists of lore. Yet lore should be doled out sparingly.

*Curseborne* falls into the trap of trying to do everything at once, and doing nothing well and creating a series of bland splats that work well together, but are otherwise insipid and unoriginal.

To add to the complexity, this chapter heavily references complex mechanics from later chapters.

**Chapter 3: The Accursed.** 

**Chapter 4: Storypath Ultra System.** The joy of the original Storyteller system was its flexibility. With the simple mechanic of combining Attribute + Ability vs Difficulty, it allowed you to come up with small systems on the fly. Or rulings, as we like to call them now. Sure, there were systems (or maybe procedures?) for combat and social conflict, but they could be hand-waved away in a moment and replaced with a simple roll.

The Storypath Ultra System (which sounds like a paramilitary group) elaborates on that core. Not only do you have Skills, Attributes and Difficulties, there are also Tricks, Complications, Momentum, Status Effects, Areas and curse die. That's a lot, and it gives the game narrative richness but it's showing *Onyx Path*'s propensity for crunch.

**Chapter 4: Making an Accursed.** I suppose it makes sense this chapter comes after the rules chapter but, as we saw from the lineages' chapter, . Again, conventional wisdom is that you should lead with the character creation rules because, well, that's the order in which you play the game: you create characters first and then learn the specific rules later. Reversing this only adds to the inaccessibility of the game.

**Chapter 5: Accursed Magic.** I miss the simplicity of disciplines from *Vampire: the Masquerade* or gifts from *Werewolf: the Apocalypse*. You either could or couldn't do an effect.

Again, complexity rears its ugly head. All Accursed can cast spells. Each spell has a number of "extras" you can buy so they become more powerful and flexible. Spells are grouped by Practices. Lineages can only access certain practices. However, some spells can be used by other lineages.

What's more, Accursed can also have other powers called Edges.

**Chapter 6: Storyguiding.** 

**Chapter 6: Adversaries.** Second only to the splats chapter, the adversaries define urban horror games.
