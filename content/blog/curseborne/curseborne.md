> Curseborne is a game about being unapologetic monsters in a world where being monstrous is the least of your worries.

_Onyx Path's_ new urban horror game [Curseborne](https://www.curseborne.com/) has brought me to crisis. I'm asking myself questions I don't really want to answer. Like: have I become everything I hate? Am I an awful grognard? Am I _uncool_?

No, that can't be right. It must be those kids at _Onyx Path Publishing_ who are wrong. Although, now I think about it, surely many of the people working the levers at OP are in my age cohort? What is _Onyx Path_ but an act of nostalgia itself? An attempt to resurrect game lines that died with _White Wolf_. And who would've been playing and then later republishing those original games? Why, the very same sort of Gen Xers I was playing with in the 90s.

Why has _Curseborne_ brought me to this crisis? Well, let me first explain what _Curseborne_ is. Now that _Paradox_ - the rights holders of the _World of Darkness_ - are publishing new material, the licenses that allowed OP to publish their own WoD products have expired. This leaves the nice people at OP without an _ahem_ IP for their specialist genre; urban horror. So, _Curseborne_ is an attempt to replace that IP with an original setting of their own.

Which is why _Curseborne_ fills me with apprehension: it is game haunted, if you will, by _Vampire: the Masquerade_, _Mage: the Ascension_ and others. It is, essentially, a product of pure nostalgia. A game written with the dubious premise "like the World of Darkness but different." Not that it's an unreasonable objective, but it comes from a place of practicality rather than creativity. _Curseborne_ doesn't start with a need and follow through with a game. It starts with a game in the hope it will become a need. It's not cynical, but maybe it's not entirely authentic either.

Of course, authenticity itself is subjective, and the accusation is probably a little unfair. *Curseborne* is a love letter to the urban horror genre, which is why I hold out hope for _Curseborne_. Can OP thread the needle here? Can lightening strike twice? Can _Curseborne_ give the _World of Darkness_ a run for its money? Or, better yet, could it be something entirely different; compelling for WoD fans, but bringing its own unique vision to the table?

Maybe, but I also have some reservations with _Onyx Path Publishing_ themselves. Their audience seems to consist mostly of hardcore WoD fans who are willing to fork out cash on Kickstarters and expensive print-on-demand editions. (No shade here, I'm one of them.) However, this can lead to derivative and lengthy works filled with tedious lore that lacks much of the inventiveness of the original games, published to feed an insatiable hunger for nostalgic content regardless of quality. Many of these works are impenetrable, obscure and, well, a bit crusty.

_White Wolf's_ real product was always cool. They seemed to be designed and illustrated by people hipper than you and, whether or not that was actually true, that's what brought new players into the games. Urban horror must be, if it is anything, stylish and desirable and _new_ and, if it isn't, then you're not really addressing new players.

So, can _Curseborne_ be stylish and desirable and _new_?

It's a question that fills me with existential dread because the lingering subtext here, the awful suspicion, is: can _anyone_ my age create something stylish and desirable and new?

It occurs to me, then, that this isn't really a review of *Curseborne* (apologies _Onyx Path_). It's more of an inquiry into my complicated feelings about the original _World of Darkness_. *Curseborne* is the focus, but it's also the mirror I'm using to interrogate my biases. Is the appeal of 90s WoD just nostalgia? Is oWoD better than any of the contemporary urban horror settings?

**Chapter 1: The World.** The book starts off with a description of the setting, and we are introduced to the concept of the cursed world. In _Curseborne_, the world itself is cursed, an intricate network of curses that feed off each other. It's a nice conceit that gives a good rational for the "our world but darker" trope of urban fantasy.

**Chapter 2: Lineages.** Here is the heart of the matter. Urban horror TTRPGs live or die by their [splats](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Splat#Fatsplats,_secondary_splats,_and_tiers). They introduce the aesthetic, core concepts, themes and motifs.

_Curseborne_ splats seem to be adapted from the _Chronicles of Darkness_/_New World of Darkness_ convention. There are a fixed set of inherent splats (like the clans from _Vampire: the Requiem_) and an expansive list of secondary splats, that refine the main concepts into more specific character types (like _Vampire: the Requiem_ bloodlines). We have the lineages which represent the core, urban horror archetypes: your vampires, werewolves, etc. And each lineage then has 5-6 secondary splats, called "families".

These families work as both social and inherent factions, and there are around 30 of them, which seems like a lot. This is where we can see _Onyx Publishing_'s verboseness coming out. The original WoD books kept splats to a minimum, usually no more than 13 in a core book. This is because splats are supposed to simplify the character creation process. You pick the splat first, and worry about the details later.

There is a reason _White Wolf_ had almost completely separate settings for each of their splats, each only tangentially linked to the others and often with contradictory lore, cosmology and play styles. I think this might be the secret ingredient of the original _World of Darkness_: instead of trying to streamline all the monster legends into one mythos and blandifying them, _White Wolf_ instead realised that each of the legends has their own core themes and motifs that would be best served by each splat having its own aesthetic and mythos, and not worrying about the contradictions.

_Curseborne_ seems to be doing the opposite of this. Each lineage is really a flat splat, with its own set of rules specific to its archetype. Once you've figured out what you want to play, only then can you start to choose a family. It's a daunting choice, and probably a meaningless one for new players. The families have subtle themes that require a bit of reading between the lines. It's not obvious, for example, that the Munificients are supposed to be djinn analogues, and families are a mix of archetypal (like the Chimerae) and original, setting-specific groups (like the ZEDs).

Now, geeks love lists of lore. Yet lore should be doled out sparingly.

_Curseborne_ falls into the trap of trying to do everything at once, and doing nothing well and creating a series of bland splats that work well together, but are otherwise insipid and unoriginal.

To add to the complexity, this chapter heavily references complex mechanics from later chapters.

**Chapter 3: The Accursed.**

**Chapter 4: Storypath Ultra System.** The joy of the original Storyteller system was its flexibility. With the simple mechanic of combining Attribute + Ability vs Difficulty, it allowed you to come up with small systems on the fly. Or rulings, as we like to call them now. Sure, there were systems (or maybe procedures?) for combat and social conflict, but they could be hand-waved away in a moment and replaced with a simple roll.

The Storypath Ultra System (which sounds like a paramilitary group) elaborates on that core. Not only do you have Skills, Attributes and Difficulties, there are also Tricks, Complications, Momentum, Status Effects, Areas and curse die. That's a lot, and it gives the game narrative richness but it's showing _Onyx Path_'s propensity for crunch.

**Chapter 4: Making an Accursed.** I suppose it makes sense this chapter comes after the rules chapter but, as we saw from the lineages' chapter, . Again, conventional wisdom is that you should lead with the character creation rules because, well, that's the order in which you play the game: you create characters first and then learn the specific rules later. Reversing this only adds to the inaccessibility of the game.

**Chapter 5: Accursed Magic.** I miss the simplicity of disciplines from _Vampire: the Masquerade_ or gifts from _Werewolf: the Apocalypse_. You either could or couldn't do an effect.

Again, complexity rears its ugly head. All Accursed can cast spells. Each spell has a number of "extras" you can buy so they become more powerful and flexible. Spells are grouped by Practices. Lineages can only access certain practices. However, some spells can be used by other lineages.

What's more, Accursed can also have other powers called Edges.

**Chapter 6: Storyguiding.**

**Chapter 6: Adversaries.** Second only to the splats chapter, the adversaries define urban horror games.

But there is no core conflict here! Merely a lot of smaller ones, that don't seem to represent any significant threat to the splats.
