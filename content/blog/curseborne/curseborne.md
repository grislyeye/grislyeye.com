> Curseborne is a game about being unapologetic monsters in a world where being monstrous is the least of your worries.

_Onyx Path's_ new urban fantasy game [Curseborne](https://www.curseborne.com/) (Onyx Path Publishing, 2025) has brought me to a crisis. I'm asking myself questions I don't really want the answers to. Like: have I become everything I hate? Am I an awful grognard? Am I _uncool_?

No, that can't be right. It must be those kids at _Onyx Path Publishing_ who are wrong. Although, now I think about it, surely many of the people working the levers at Onyx are in my age cohort? What is Onyx but an act of nostalgia itself? An attempt to resurrect game lines that died with _White Wolf_. And who would've been playing and then later republishing those original games? Why, the very same sort of Gen Xers I was playing with in the 90s.

Why has _Curseborne_ brought me to this crisis? Well, let me first explain what _Curseborne_ is. Now that _Paradox_ - the rights holders of the _World of Darkness_ - are publishing new material, the licenses that allowed Onyx to publish their own WoD products have expired. This leaves them quite without an IP for their specialist genre; urban fantasy. So, _Curseborne_ is an attempt to replace Paradox IP with an original setting of their own.

Which is why _Curseborne_ fills me with apprehension: it is game haunted, if you will, by _Vampire: the Masquerade_, _Mage: the Ascension_ and others. It is, essentially, a product of pure nostalgia. A game written with the dubious premise "like the World of Darkness but different." Not that it's an unreasonable objective, but it comes from a place of practicality rather than creativity. _Curseborne_ doesn't start with a need and follow through with a game. It starts with a game in the hope it will become a need. It's not cynical, but maybe it's not entirely authentic either.

Of course, authenticity itself is subjective, and the accusation is probably a little unfair. As you'll see, _Curseborne_ is something of a love letter to the urban fantasy genre, which is why I hold out hope for it. Can Onyx thread the needle here? Can lightening strike twice? Can _Curseborne_ give the _World of Darkness_ a run for its money? Or, better yet, could it be something entirely different; compelling for WoD fans, but bringing its own unique vision to the table?

Maybe, but I also have some reservations with _Onyx Path Publishing_ themselves. Their audience seems to consist mostly of hardcore WoD fans who are willing to fork out cash on Kickstarters and expensive print-on-demand editions. (No shade here, I'm one of them.) This can lead to derivative and lengthy works filled with tedious lore that lacks much of the inventiveness of the original games, published to feed an insatiable hunger for nostalgic content regardless of quality. Many of these works are impenetrable, obscure and, well, a bit crusty.

_White Wolf's_ real product was always cool. They seemed to be designed and illustrated by people hipper than you and, whether or not that was actually true, that's what brought new players into the games. urban fantasy must be, if it is anything, stylish and desirable and _new_ and, if it isn't, well, what are you doing?

So, can _Curseborne_ be stylish and desirable and _new_?

It's a question that fills me with existential dread because the lingering subtext here, the awful suspicion, is: can _anyone_ my age create something stylish and desirable and new?

It occurs to me, then, that this isn't really a review of _Curseborne_ (sorry Onyx). It's more of an inquiry into my complicated feelings about the original _World of Darkness_. _Curseborne_ is the focus, but it's also the mirror I'm using to interrogate my biases. Is the appeal of 90s WoD just nostalgia? Is oWoD better than any of the contemporary urban fantasy settings?

**Chapter 1: The World.** The book starts off with an high-level summary to the setting, and we are introduced to the concept of the cursed world. In _Curseborne_ the world is filled with curses. Everyone experiences a constant stream of these curses creating a permanent dismal atmosphere, but the Accursed are more cursed. So cursed they have  They have inherited your standard spread of urban fantasy curses: lycanthropy, vampirism and others. And, of course, with their curses come supernatural powers and access to magic, because it's not urban fantasy without powers.

A supporting pillar of the urban fantasy genre asks, "why is no one talking about all these monsters running around?" Your urban fantasy monster is defined in opposition to regular humanity, which means they need to occupy a (relatively) normal world. The WoD used a variety of inventive In *Curseborne* there's no Masquerade, no Technocracy, no grand conspiracy. Most people simply rationalise their experiences with the supernatural away. They just don't care, which is at least an original sharp right-turn away from the angst of the WoD.

Most of the rest of the chapter is then dedicated to the cosmology of the setting, which revolves around "liminalities." Liminalities are folds in reality, small dimensions that are hidden away from the rest of world. Here, the Accursed can play out their dramas without fear of discovery. They are havens, adventure locations, plot devices, even NPCs or treasures. And they are, of course, liminal, not just places between magic and the mundane, but also liminal in the contemporary horror sense. I'm not going to get into a discussion on the subject of liminal horror in this post, it's too big a subject. However, it is fashionable.

So far so good. The setting elements - liminalities, Accursed, etc. - are inventive, sympathetic to the themes and give a creative arena of play. It's a little tepid, but the bones are solid

Like the _Chronicles of Darkness_, *Curseborne* is less global, with less canon. It's more distributed and local. There is no overarching conflict. Unfortunately, this also leaves the setting a little... uninspiring? I'm don't immediately understand what player characters are supposed to do. I don't immediately identify with the Accursed. What stories are you I supposed to tell? Liminalities sound cool at first, but the execution is confusing and complicated. Most liminalities are places, but they can also be people and things. They serve a variety of functions, some very specific, which hint at 

**Chapter 2: Lineages.** Here is the heart of the matter. Urban fantasy TTRPGs live or die by their [splats](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Splat#Fatsplats,_secondary_splats,_and_tiers). They introduce the aesthetic, core concepts, themes and motifs.

_Curseborne_ splats seem to be adapted from the _Chronicles of Darkness_/_New World of Darkness_ convention. There are a fixed set of inherent splats (like the clans from _Vampire: the Requiem_) and an expansive list of secondary splats, that refine the main concepts into more specific character types (like _Vampire: the Requiem_ bloodlines). We have the "lineages" which represent the core, urban fantasy archetypes: your vampires, werewolves, etc. And each lineage then has 5-6 secondary splats, called "families".

These families work as both social and inherent factions, and there are around 30 of them, which seems like a lot. And here we come to my first, big objection to _Curseborne_. The original WoD books kept splats to a minimum, usually no more than 13 in a core book. This is because splats are supposed to simplify the character creation process. You pick the splat first, and worry about the details later.

There is a reason _White Wolf_ had almost completely separate settings for each of their splats, each only tangentially linked to the others and often with contradictory lore, cosmology and play styles. I think this might be the secret sauce of the original _World of Darkness_: instead of trying to streamline all the monster legends into one mythos and blandifying them, _White Wolf_ instead realized that each of the legends has their own core themes and motifs that would be best served by each splat having its own aesthetic and mythos, and not worrying about the contradictions.

_Curseborne_ seems to be doing the opposite of this. Each lineage is really a flat splat, with its own set of rules specific to its archetype. Once you've figured out what you want to play, only then can you start to choose a family. It's a daunting choice, and probably a meaningless one for new players. The families have subtle themes that require a bit of reading between the lines. It's not obvious, for example, that the Munificients are supposed to be djinn analogues, and families are a mix of archetypal (like the Chimerae) and original, setting-specific groups (like the ZEDs).

Now, geeks love lists of lore. Yet lore should be doled out sparingly.

_Curseborne_ falls into the trap of trying to do everything at once, and doing nothing well and creating a series of bland splats that work well together, but are otherwise insipid and unoriginal.

To add to the complexity, this chapter heavily references complex mechanics from later chapters.

What's more, the Accursed are supposed to be tormented, damned, yet many of the lineages and families don't seem particularly tortured.

**Chapter 3: The Accursed.**

**Chapter 4: Storypath Ultra System.** The joy of the original Storyteller system was its flexibility. With the simple mechanic of combining Attribute + Ability vs Difficulty, it allowed you to come up with small systems on the fly. Or rulings, as we like to call them now. Sure, there were systems (or maybe procedures?) for combat and social conflict, but they could be hand-waved with a single roll.

The Storypath Ultra System (doesn't that sound just like a paramilitary group?) is far more elaborate. Not only do you have Skills, Attributes and Difficulties, there are also Tricks, Complications, Momentum, Status Effects, Areas and curse die. That's a lot. Perhaps it gives narrative richness, but it's showing _Onyx Path_'s propensity for complexity.

**Chapter 4: Making an Accursed.** I suppose it makes sense this chapter comes after the rules chapter but, as we saw from the lineages' chapter, . Again, conventional wisdom is that you should lead with the character creation rules because, well, that's the order in which you play the game: you create characters first and then learn the specific rules later. Reversing this only adds to the inaccessibility of the game.

**Chapter 5: Accursed Magic.** I miss the simplicity of disciplines from _Vampire: the Masquerade_ or gifts from _Werewolf: the Apocalypse_. You either could or couldn't do an effect.

Again, complexity rears its ugly head. All Accursed can cast spells. Each spell has a number of "extras" you can buy so they become more powerful and flexible. Spells are grouped by Practices. Lineages can only access certain practices. However, some spells can be used by other lineages.

What's more, Accursed can also have other powers called Edges.

**Chapter 6: Storyguiding.**

**Chapter 6: Adversaries.** Second only to the splats chapter, the adversaries define urban fantasy games.

But there is no core conflict here! Merely a lot of smaller ones, that don't seem to represent any significant threat to the splats.

To be honest, _Curseborne_ isn't bad. It has some nice elements and perhaps I shouldn't judge before it's had time to properly bed in. A few good supplements can turn a game line around, or elaborate on the original designers intentions to reveal a better game beneath.

What it isn't is a beginner's game. I'm not sure new player's could properly consume it without the complicated historical context of the *World of Darkness* game lines that came before. Is *Curseborne* more complicated than _Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition_? No. Could it easily be a lot simpler? Absolutely.
