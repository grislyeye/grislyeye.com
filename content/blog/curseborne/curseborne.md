*Onyx Path's* new urban horror game [Curseborne](https://www.curseborne.com/) has brought me to crisis. I'm asking myself questions I don't really want to answer. Like: have I become everything I hate? Am I an awful grognard? Am I *uncool*?

No, that can't be right. It must be those kids at *Onyx Publishing* who are wrong. Although, now I think about it, surely many of the people working the levers at OP are in my age cohort? What is *Onyx Publishing* but an act of nostalgia itself? An attempt to resurrect game lines that died with *White Wolf*. And who would've been playing and then later republishing those original games? Why, the very same sort of Gen Xers I was playing with in the 90s.

Why has *Curseborne* brought me to this crisis? Well, let me first explain what *Curseborne* is. Now that *Paradox* - the new rights holders of the *World of Darkness* - are publishing new material, the licenses that allowed OP to publish their own WoD products have expired. This leaves the nice people at OP without an *ahem* IP for their specialist genre; urban horror. And *Curseborne* is an attempt to replace that IP with an original setting of their own.

Which is why *Curseborne* fills me with apprehension: it is game haunted, if you will, by *Vampire: the Masquerade*, *Mage: the Ascension* and others. It is, essentially, a product of pure nostalgia. A game written with the dubious premise "like the World of Darkness but different." Not that it's an unrealistic objective, but it comes from a place of practicality rather than creativity. *Curseborne* doesn't start with a need and follow through with a game. It starts with a game in the hope it will become a need. It's not exactly cynical, but maybe it's not entirely authentic either.

Of course, authenticity is subjective which is why I held out hope for *Curseborne*. Can OP thread the needle here? Can lightening strike twice? Can *Curseborne* give the *World of Darkness* a run for its money? Or, better yet, could it be something entirely different; compelling for WoD fans, but bringing its own unique vision to the table?

Maybe. However, I have reservations with *Onyx Publishing* themselves. Their audience seems to consist mostly of hardcore WoD fans who are willing to fork out cash on Kickstarters and expensive print-on-demand editions. (No shade here, I'm one of them.) However, this leads to derivative and lengthy works, filled with tedious lore that lacks much of the inventiveness of the original games, published to feed an insatiable hunger for nostalgic content regardless of quality. These works are impenetrable, obscure and, well, a bit crusty. They aren't really addressing new players. And urban horror must be, if it is anything, stylish and desirable and *new*.

Can *Curseborne* escape this trap? Can *Onyx Publishing* be stylish and desirable and new?

It's a question that fills me with existential dread, because the lingering subtext here, the awful suspicion, is: can *anyone* my age  create something stylish and desirable and new?
