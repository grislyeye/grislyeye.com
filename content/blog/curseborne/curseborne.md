[Curseborne](https://www.curseborne.com/) has forced me to come face-to-face with my biases. Are the games I cherished (and use as measure for these reviews) really as good as I remember? Or am I suffering from a surfeit of nostalgia? Have I become hidebound? Have I become everything I hate? Am I an awful grognard? Am I *uncool*?

No, that can't be right. It must be those kids at *Onyx Publishing* who are wrong. Although, now I think about it, surely many of the people working the levers at OP are actually in my age cohort? What is *Onyx Publishing* but an act of nostalgia itself? An attempt to resurrect game lines that died with *White Wolf*. And who would've been playing and then republishing those original games? Why, the very same people I was playing with in the 90s.

Why has *Curseborne* brought me to this crisis? Well, let me first explain what *Curseborne* is. Now that *Paradox* - the new rights holders of the *World of Darkness* - are publishing new material, the licenses that allowed OP to publish their own have expired. This leaves the nice people at OP without an *ahem* IP for their specialist genre, urban horror. *Curseborne* is an attempt to replace that IP with an original setting of their own.

Which is why *Curseborne* fills me with apprehension: it is game haunted, if you will, by *Vampire: the Masquerade*, *Mage: the Ascension* and others. It not only has to live up to the WoD, it is essentially a product of pure nostalgia. A game written with the dubious premise "like the World of Darkness but different." Not that it isn't an unrealistic objective, but that it comes from a place of practical need rather than creative expression. *Curseborne* doesn't start with a need and follows through with a game. It starts with a game in the hope it will become a need. It's not exactly cynical, but it's not entirely authentic either.

Of course, authenticity is a problematic term itself, which is why I held out hope for *Curseborne*. Can OP thread the needle here? Can lightening strike twice? Could *Curseborne* love up to the expectations of the *World of Darkness*? Or, better yet, could it be something entirely different, compelling for WoD fans, but bringing its own unique vision to the table?

Maybe. However, I have other reservations. Firstly, *Curseborne* is an attempt to create a new taxonomy of the standard supernatural beings (or splats). Your werewolves, vampires, etc. Rather than give each their own game, *Curseborne* attempts to create one core mythology to explain them all. But, for me, the appeal of the oWoD games is that each one carefully focussed on one splat. They came with compelling themes, conflicts and concerns that fitted each type of monster like a glove. I'm not sure you can squeeze every type of supernatural into a single game without it just becoming a farcical monster mash.

My other concerns lie with *Onyx Publishing* themselves. Their audience seems to consist mostly of hardcore WoD fans who are willing to fork out money on Kickstarters and expensive print-on-demand editions. (No shade here, I'm one of them.) However, this leads to derivative and lengthy works, filled with tedious lore that lacks much of the inventiveness of the original games, published to feed an insatiable hunger for nostalgic content regardless of quality. They rely on a lot of implicit knowledge, making them obscure and a bit crusty to new players. And urban horror must be, if anything, stylish and desirable and *new*.

Can *Curseborne* escape this trap? Can *Onyx Publishing* be stylish and desirable and new? Let's see...
