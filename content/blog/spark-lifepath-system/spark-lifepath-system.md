There's plenty of advice out there (such as *[On writing spark tables](https://noisesanssignal.blogspot.com/2025/01/on-writing-spark-tables.html)* or *[Build An Adventure Site ](https://cairnrpg.com/first-edition/tools/build-an-adventure-site/#create-spark-tables)*) so this won't be a tutorial on

A plugin lifepath system that uses spark tables and describe setting as tables. To design your own lifepath system create:

* Create general spark tables for your setting using its common themes and motifs
* A rumour table (Random rumour tables as lore).
* d66 tables for the locations, cultures, backgrounds, and careers from your setting.
* A table of notable NPCs.

## Setting as tables

Player's can then follow this process to create their character:

1. Roll for your homeland from the locations table
2. Roll for you culture and/or background
3. Roll for you career
4. Roll once on the spark table for each of the following:
	1. Personality
	2. Style of appearance
	3. Distinctive feature
	4. Core value
	6. Most valued possession
	7. Life goal
5. Roll on the rumour table for an important event in your past.
6. You have <vellum-dice animation>1d10-7</vellum-dice> (ignore negatives) close friends or relationships:
	1. There is a 2-in-6 chance each friend or relationship is a notable NPC, or related to one
	2. Otherwise, roll on the spark table for each.
7. You have <vellum-dice animation>1d10-7</vellum-dice> (ignore negatives) enemies:
	1. There is a 2-in-6 (<vellum-dice hidedice>1d6</vellum-dice>) chance each enemy is a notable NPC, or related to one.
	2. Otherwise, roll on the spark table for each.
	3. Roll on the spark table for each to determine what the resolution might be.

This method is heavily inspired by the system from *Cyberpunk RED*. Spark tables for this system will have to be quite large (d66 by d66 perhaps) to create unique outcomes for each player.

This system requires large spark tables so as to avoid frequent duplications. You can roll 6-30 times on the same spark table (although this is unlikely), so at least three, d20 spark tables might be required.

## Dismas Remade

This is an example spark lifepath system I designed for my home campaign, [Dismas Remade](https://dismas.grislyeye.com).

### 1. Roll for homeland

Roll for your homeland from the locations table below. If you roll a 12, roll on the Other Lands table below that for a more uncommon land of origin.

### Example character

Let's create a sample character from the above lifepath system, as an example of how you can use the above to spark together a character. Here is an example of the rolls according to the process above:

<dl>
<dt>Homeland:</dt>
<dd>Dismas</dd>

<dt>Background:</dt>
<dd>Zealots</dd>

<dt>Career:</dt>
<dd>Boatman</dd>

<dt>Past event:</dt>
<dd>The Thieves' Council's agreement with the New Commonwealth.</dd>

<dt>Personality</dt>
<dd>Slouch Maim</dd>

<dt>Style:</dt>
<dd>Cold Sausage</dd>

<dt>Distinctive feature:</dt>
<dd>Swat Craft</dd>

<dt>Core value:</dt>
<dd>Hunger Maim</dd>

<dt>Prize possession:</dt>
<dd>Followed Dung</dd>

<dt>Life Goal:</dt>
<dd>Perspiration Fanatic</dd>

<dt>Friends:</dt>
<dd>None</dd>

<dt>Enemy:</dt>
<dd>Notable NPC, Spark: Wail Mould, Resolution: Mutter Gawp</dd>
</dl>

Let's begin with the homeland and background first. Our character is from Dismas and grew up among zealots. In my setting, Dismas is surrounding lands are known as the Bishopric of Dismas. Recently, they were a source of a religious mania in which most of the inhabitants were swept away, effectively emptying the entire area. Our character is not such a zealot, but perhaps a child left behind in the fanatical crowd, an orphan of the Mad Bishop's crusade.
