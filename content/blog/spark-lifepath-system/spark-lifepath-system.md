A plugin lifepath system that uses spark tables and describe setting as tables. To design your own lifepath system create:

* Create general spark tables for your setting using its common themes and motifs
* A rumour table (Random rumour tables as lore).
* d66 tables for the locations, cultures, backgrounds, and careers from your setting.
* A table of notable NPCs.

Player's can then follow this process to create their character:

1. Roll for your homeland from the locations table
2. Roll for you culture and/or background
3. Roll for you career
4. Roll once on the spark table for each of the following:
	1. Personality
	2. Style of appearance
	3. Distinctive feature
	4. Core value
	6. Most valued possession
	7. Life goal
5. Roll on the rumour table for an important event in your past.
6. You have 1d10-7 (ignore negatives) close friends or relationships:
	1. There is a 2-in-6 chance each friend or relationship is a notable NPC, or related to one
	2. Otherwise, roll on the spark table for each.
7. You have 1d10-7 (ignore negatives) enemies:
	1. There is a 2-in-6 chance each enemy is a notable NPC, or related to one.
	2. Otherwise, roll on the spark table for each.
	3. Roll on the spark table for each to determine what the resolution might be.

This method is heavily inspired by the system from *Cyberpunk RED*. Spark tables for this system will have to be quite large (d66 by d66 perhaps) to create unique outcomes for each player.

This system requires large spark tables so as to avoid frequent duplications. You can roll 6-30 times on the same spark table (although this is unlikely), so at least three, d20 spark tables might be required.
