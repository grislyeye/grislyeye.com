**Rating:** ⭐️⭐️⭐️

</aside>

Has zombie horror reached market saturation? Apparently not. *[Fever House](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66087060-fever-house)* by Keith Posson is a new entry in the genre. 

The paperback I picked up was an attractive volume. The pages have red edges and the cover is a lurid picture of a hand, reminiscent of grind house or photocopied flyers. Very metal. But inside?

The pitch is zombies but punk, a promising premise. Unfortunately, lacklustre characters and poor pacing let things down. The second half of the book rehashes a bunch of zombie clichés, leading to a somewhat derivative apocalypse. The writing is competent, the occult elements are a nice touch and the twist at the end is suitably dark, but the end result is a distinctly mid entry in a tired genre.
