Have we reached peak zombie? Apparently not. _[Fever House](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66087060-fever-house)_ (2023) by Keith Posson is a new entry in the genre.

Truth be told, I'm pretty sick of zombie horror. It feels like we've exhausted all its permutations, reaching a hopeless loop where the same movie gets made every few years. Can _Fever House_ bring something new to the table?

The paperback edition I picked up was an attractive volume. The pages have red edges and the cover is a lurid picture of a hand, reminiscent of grindhouse or photocopied flyers. Very punk. But inside?

Unfortunately, the first half is let down by lacklustre characters and poor pacing. The second half of the book rehashes a bunch of zombie clichés, leading to an apocalypse that is somehow derivative. The writing is competent, the occult elements are a nice touch and the twist is suitably dark, but the end result is a distinctly middling entry in a tired genre.

Will I pick up the [second volume](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202102065-the-devil-by-name)? Probably, if only to find out what happens, which I suppose means I liked something about it.
