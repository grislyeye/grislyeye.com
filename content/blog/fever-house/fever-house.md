**Rating:** ⭐️⭐️⭐️

</aside>

Has zombie horror reached market saturation? Apparently not. *[Fever House](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66087060-fever-house)* by Keith Posson is a new entry in the genre. 

The paperback I picked up was an attractive volume. The pages have a red coloured edge, and the cover is a lurid picture of a hand, reminiscent of grind house or photocopied flyers. Very metal. But inside?

The pitch is zombies but punk. It's a noodly affair, switching between the perspectives of an ensemble of sketchy characters. We have gangsters, secret government programs, occultists and washed-up rock stars.

Each of the characters are given a *past*, each revealed through secondary stories, little vignettes that are supposed to emphasise the themes of the book.

Unfortunately, the characters weren't particularly interesting, so the constant reminiscing just gets in the way of the pacing. The second half of the book rehashes a bunch of zombie clichés, leading to a somewhat anti-climactic apocalypse. The writing is competent, the occult elements are a nice touch and the twist at the end is suitably dark, but the end result is a distinctly mid entry in a tired genre.
