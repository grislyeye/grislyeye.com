**Rating:** ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

</aside>

I first started reading [Little, Big](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/90619.Little_Big) (John Crowley, 1981) in the nineties, but somehow didn't make it all the way through. As I recall it was on the reading list for *Changeling: the Dreaming* 1st edition but perhaps it was a bit too mature for me then.

I'm delighted to report that, a quarter of a century later, I have finally completed it, and have discovered that its virtues are many. Among them:

It is **charming** in a way only the whimsical can be, but it is a particular strain of whimsy distinct to the period in time. Rustic charm as seen through a haze of pot, vaguely surreal and dreamy. It is long Autumn days spent reading in a library. It is *Charlie Brown* specials, *Puff, the Magic Dragon*, Laura Ashley and *Blue Peter* craft demonstrations. It is peacock chairs, *Watership Down* and *The Hungry Caterpillar*.

*Little, Big* is reminiscent of all that, and more. An age that was waning when I was young, but that still overshadowed children's entertainment at the time. An aesthetic I am struggling to articulate here, but that this book captures.

It is entirely **poignant**, an epic that follows the lives of three generations of a sprawling, gnarled family tree. Promises are made, broken and then kept again. Relationships flounder, only to be reconciled. Loved ones disappear only to reappear later or, more engaging still, remain lost. One generation's heroes become the next's antagonists. Adults haunted by fairy tales and other childish things. All written with slumbering poetry and loving prose.

It is **unique** - fantasy, certainly - but not a form of fantasy I have read before.

Finally, it is **heartbreaking** because it is so redolent of my youth. A book so vivid I can almost smell it, yet I hardly remember why it resonates so.

Like a dream, I suppose.
