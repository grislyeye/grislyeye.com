Do you ever read books that seem to be written with a film adaptation in mind? Bare-bones, script-like prose. Dialogue punchy but bland. Characters so everyday you could shop around for casting.

_[Hidden Pictures](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58724923-hidden-pictures)_ by Jason Rekulak is one such book. I'm not even sure it would make a particularly good film. Maybe an OK one. Perhaps a Netflix thriller with a script saved by a good cast. I'm just not sure I want to read your book if it's just a stepping stone towards an inevitable adaptation. If your focus isn't the book, then surely it doesn't deserve the reader's attention?

Regardless, _Hidden Pictures_ is instantly forgettable. I read it three months ago and I barely remember anything about it. The twist was silly, the characters were dreary and it wasn't particularly, you know, horrifying for a horror.

I gave this two stars just because it's at least readable.
