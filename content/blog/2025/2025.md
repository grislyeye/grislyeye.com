2025 was a hard pill to swallow. The political ramifications of the year are, quite frankly, horrifying.  We're so fucked but, then, I could probably say that of every year for the last two decades. It only ever seems to get worse but I'm not going to cover that on my silly little blog. Instead, here is how my year went.

**Publishing:** I (finally) released [CONT/EXT](/products/context),  my *Mothership* one-shot. It was my most successful release to date, and I sold about a couple of hundred print and digital copies. It even got stocked by *Tuesday Knight Games*. I'm pretty stoked with its success, but I think I can beat that and I have high hopes I can make [Shift](/products/shift) even better.

**Gaming:** After about 10 years being a forever GM I took a break from running games. It was nice to get back some spare time and enjoy being a player, for once. We played *Forbidden Lands* (of course), *Ironsworn: Starforged*, *Daggerheart* and *Monsterhearts 2*.

**Reading:** According to Goodreads (please follow me [there](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134068124-ric-wood)) I read 86 books. While it was a productive year reading-wise, that can't be right but I certainly read *a lot*. 

I reviewed [Linghun](/blog/linghun) and [Fever House](/blog/fever-house), and started a rather successful book club with my players. Some of my top-rated reads included [Little, Big](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/90619.Little_Big) and [Our Share of Night](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61111034-our-share-of-night).

**Resolutions:** I lost a lot of focus last year and struggled with motivation. Thanks to the miracles of psychiatric pharmacology, some of my drive returned and I'm hoping to bring that energy into 26.

Firstly, I'm planning to blog at least once a week, even if it's just a couple of paragraphs like the micro-reviews I've been publishing. I have more ambitious posts planned as well, including readings of *Curseborne* and *Forgotten and Forbidden Orders*, and a detailed AP review of *Forbidden Lands*.

I'm also going to get serious with some of the projects on my back-burner, including [Shift](/products/shift) and [The Dell Triptych](/products/dell-triptych/). I'm hoping to get into a more regular publishing cycle.

Finally, my play group has plans to run more games, including *Dragonbane*, *Vampire: the Masquerade* and *Mage: the Ascension* (I think I'm over my OSR phase). And, of course, I'll be getting back to GMing my long-term campaign, [Dismas Remade](https://dismas.grislyeye.com), which I have a feeling might finally wind up this year.
