2025 was a hard pill to swallow. The political ramifications of the year are, quite frankly, horrifying. We're so fucked, but, then, I could say that of every year for the last two decades. It only ever seems to get worse (_03/01/26 addendum: it did get worse)_, but the subject of global politics is probably out-of-scope for my silly little blog. So, instead, here is how my year went.

**Publishing:** I (finally) released [CONT/EXT](/products/context), my _Mothership_ one-shot. It was my most successful release to date, and I sold about a couple of hundred copies, print and digital. It even got stocked by [Tuesday Knight Games](https://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/products/cont-ext). I'm pretty stoked with its success, but I think I can beat that, and I have high hopes [Shift](/products/shift) will be even better.

**Gaming:** After about 10 years of being a forever GM I took a break from running games. It was nice to get back some spare time and enjoy being a player for once. Since then, I've had some very talented GMs run _Forbidden Lands_, _Ironsworn: Starforged_, _Daggerheart_ and _Monsterhearts 2_ for me.

**Reading:** According to Goodreads (please follow me [there](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134068124-ric-wood)) I read 86 books in 2025. While it was a productive year reading-wise, that can't be right, but I certainly read _a lot_. Some of my top-rated reads included [Anno Dracula](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8970727-anno-dracula), [Little, Big](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/90619.Little_Big) (review incoming) and [Our Share of Night](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61111034-our-share-of-night) (Argentinian horror is on a high right now). I also posted reviews of [Linghun](/blog/linghun) and [Fever House](/blog/fever-house), and started a rather successful book club with my players.

**Resolutions:** I struggled a lot with motivation last year. Thanks to the miracles of psychiatric pharmacology, some of my drive returned, and I'm hoping to bring that energy into 26.

Firstly, I'm planning to blog at least once a week, even if it's just a couple of paragraphs like the micro-reviews I've been publishing. I have more ambitious posts planned, including readings of _Curseborne_ and _Forgotten and Forbidden Orders_, and a detailed AP review of _Forbidden Lands_.

I'm also going to get serious with some of the projects on my back-burner, including [Shift](/products/shift) and [The Dell Triptych](/products/dell-triptych/). I'm hoping to get into a more regular publishing cycle.

My gaming group plans to run more games, including _Dragonbane_, _Vampire: the Masquerade_ and _Mage: the Ascension_ (I think I'm over my OSR phase). And, of course, I'll be getting back to GMing my long-term campaign, [Dismas Remade](https://dismas.grislyeye.com).

Finally, with the help of my players, we'll be restarting the [Black Griffin campaign diaries](/blog/black-griffin-session-30.html). Written in the form of a theatrical script, these were edited logs from my low fantasy, play-by-chat campaign which ran from 2017 to 2021. Once we've done with that, we'll publish campaign diaries for Dismas Remade, the sequel to Black Griffin. There are about 10 years worth of play in total. And we're planning to publish a campaign book for the City of Dismas when we've finished.
