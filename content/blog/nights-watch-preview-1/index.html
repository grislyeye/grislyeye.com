<p>The <strong>Nights Watch</strong> is a new faction I'm playing around with for a future campaign. I like the idea of individuals with shady pasts forced together (as with my current playtest campaign, [Black Griffin](black-griffin-campaign.html)). Nights watchmen have a similar theme, but for more city-based campaigns.</p>

  <h3>The Nights Watch</h3>
  <p><em>Minor faction (militia)</em></p>
</header>

<p>Who better to catch a thief... than a thief? The Nights Watch is a collection of misfits, criminals and vagabonds who have been given a second chance. Provided, that is, they undertake the deadliest task in the city: patrolling its streets at night.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Gallows Men.</em></strong> Nights watchmen are sometimes known as gallows men because they're often recruited from beneath the gallows. Given the grim choice of a certain death from hanging now versus an uncertain death on the streets later, most chose to the later. </p>

<p>There are, of course, no third chances. While nights watchmen still have the freedom of the city, they may never leave the city. Unless, of course, they do so in a casket. And if they are caught breaking the law again, its straight back to the gallows.</p>

<p><strong><em>In the Shadows.</em></strong> Nights watchmen live very much in the shadows of the Day Watch. In their shining armour, the <q>brave</q> men and women of the Day Watch get all the best equipment, medals, and all the glory. All too often they take claim of victories that, more properly, belong to nights watchmen. Still, a small price to pay to escape death.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Collars.</em></strong> Nights watchmen are known by their black uniforms and the hooded lanterns they carry. But they're most known by the rope collars they bear: a constant reminder of where they came from, and where they still might go!</p>

<h4>Beliefs and Goals</h4>

<p>Nights watchmen live (and often die) by one, simple edict:</p>

<p><strong>Keep the Night's Watch.</strong> Keep the King's Peace from dusk 'till dawn. (Lawful)</p>
