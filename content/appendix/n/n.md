This is my `/appendix/n` slash page which collects my influences and inspirations, or at least those that come to mind.

If you don't know, [slash pages](https://slashpages.net/) are common pages with well-known urls, like `/now` or `/about`.  An `/appendix/n` slash page is for your own, personal [Appendix N](https://dungeonsdragons.fandom.com/wiki/Appendix_N).

 I'd really like to see this become a common convention, so please add an `/appendix/n` slash page to your site or blog, and @ me for a boost or help. If I get enough I could collect them in an index, or something.
