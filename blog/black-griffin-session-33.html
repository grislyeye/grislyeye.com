          <p>This is the <em>fourth</em> campaign diary for my 5th Edition D&amp;D playtest campaign, <span class="product">Black Griffin</span>. Black Griffin is a play-by-chat game that runs every week on Roll20. The party are mercenaries in the employ of the infamous Company of the Black Griffin. Lowly even for sellswords, they have been placed on punishment duty as company <q>fetches</q>: bounty hunters charged with capture of deserters for trial.</p>

<p>The below is an edited log from of our <q>in-character</q> chat channel. We've added annotations so you can follow what's going on. Please enjoy!</p>

<h5>Scene IV: Night 1 (Continued)</h5>

<p>When we last left our misaligned bounty hunters they had just challenged a group of Royalist bailiffs interrogating junior members of their mercenary company.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stands up straight and stares and the Sergeant, head half turned.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">notices Biron for the first time and squares up to him, while giving Ba the side eye.</p>
  <p>We are in the King's lands and the King's Law stands here! I have a warrant to question anyone I please. Speaking of which...
Do you have a dog?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">growling</span> Does it look like it?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">smiles.</p>
  <p><span class="action">calmly</span> I do not own a dog.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>River! I hope she’s okay!</q></p>
  <p>Liam says, <q>It’s a shame we had to leave her behind in Dismas.</q></p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">raises an eyebrow.</p>
  <p>Yes, it does look like it.</p>
  <p class="action">She looks Biron up and down.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">keeps eye contact and stands squarely in front of the sergeant.</p>
  <p>You lookin’ for somin’?</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The situation gets more tense; the bailiffs about Helia reach for the pommels of their swords.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">snorts, but doesn’t break eye contact.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Traitors, spies that escaped capture.</p>
  <p>Have you been in Dismas recently?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>We go wherever the king needs us.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">barks</span> So you come to our camp, on a witch hunt?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">eyes narrow.</p>
  <p>There are witches here too?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">strafes a step around the sergeant, still looking at her, to see how she moves.</p>
  <p>He rolls his eyes.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Hmmm, make an intimidation check, with advantage.</q></p>
  <p>Liam rolls 7 for Ba’s Charisma (Intimidation) check.</p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>Woah, sorry.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>First roll is always terrible!</q></p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">tries to catch the twins attention.</p>
  <p>Go get Agata.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Stay where you are!</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The twins look wide eyed between Ba and Helia, but do not move.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Where are you from?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sniffs.</p>
  <p>Norton.</p>
  <p><span class="action">more cautiously</span> And you?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>The Forests.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p>You think that buys you some favor? Do you think me so soft?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">scoffs</span> Soft?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I'll ask you again... Were you in Dismas within the last week?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">growls again.</p>
  <p><span class="action">motions to Ba</span> What he said. Now get outta here.</p>
  <p>You done pestering? Or would you like every one in the camp…</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Liam says, <q>How far are we from Agata’s tent? If I sprint all out…</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>Orin is going to sneak through the encampment to find Agata.</q></p>
  <p>Liam says, <q>Ah, twinsies!</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>Lol, let Orin do it, there’s no sense in Orin being backup since this had better not become a fight.</q></p>
  <p>Liam says, <q>I’ll stay, then.</q></p>
</aside>

<p>The bailiffs behind her draw their swords! One particularly large fellow with black skin growls.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Bailiff</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Show some respect.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">steps forward a little.</p>
  <p>You need to put your sword away. NOW!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sees the threat from where they hide in the shadows. They turn away from the scene, weaving in between tents in the direction of Agata's.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">raises her hand to stay her bailiffs.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">seeing the Sergeant-Bailiff, nods to her.</p>
  <p class="action">He steps back again, leaving the floor to her.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">doesn’t take his eyes off Helia.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">cracks a smile broken by the scar running across her face. The smile does not reach her eyes.</p>
  <p>Let me be clear. I have a warrant to interrogate who I please in this camp. Over the next few days I'll be looking around and let me tell you this:</p>
  <p>I will find the traitors who bore your arms and escaped the King's Army.</p>
  <p>Do you understand?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stares silently at her for a moment.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">smiles and nods.</p>
  <p>As you wish… But I'll be around to make sure you’re not just bullying confessions out of innocent, hard working men.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">cracks a small smile himself and looks away.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Is there such a thing as an innocent mercenary?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>The south seems to have affected you.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Her soldiers laugh behind her at the jest.</p>

<aside>
  <p>Chris says, <q>Is this the king we also serve?</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Unfortunately, yes. He’s one of the three squabbling kings that are prosecuting the war against the Commonwealth.</q></p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p>And who exactly are you two?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">bows again low.</p>
  <p><span class="action">in his native tongue</span> Ba’ Raknul at your service.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>We're the guys doing our job at the front line of a battle. And you come to cause trouble with them?</p>
  <p>The ones who serve your king?</p>
  <p>Where's the pride in that?</p>
  <p>Where is the honour? Or did you leave that at home too?</p>
  <p class="action">He gives Helia a death look.</p>
  <p class="action">Then a smile.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Chris says, <q>Biron’s found a mate!</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>Lol, I wondered if that’s what was happening.</q></p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>Hard to tell with northerners. Fighting and courting? Pretty much the same thing, it’s just primal.</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Ha ha, it wasn’t just me and the tension in that scene then?</q></p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I'll not take lessons in honour from a sellsword! And watch your tongue or I'll have you in chains!</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>At that moment, Sergeant Agata appears with Orin in tow. She's dressed in a white nightgown and is accompanied by Loth in full uniform.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>What is going on here?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">steps backs once Agata arrives.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Our king’s finest were interrogating the men.</p>
  <p>It looked more like bullying confessions from scared kids to me.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Seemed a little suspicious, bearing in mind our other... issues today.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sighs.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Corporals Biron, Ba'Raknul. Stand down.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">nods and backs away.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns to Helia.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Apologies, Sergeant Helia. Your prompt arrival didn't give me time to make everyone...</p>
  <p class="action">She looks sharply at Biron and Ba.</p>
  <p>...aware of your presence. Perhaps Corporal Loth could show you to your quarters and we could discuss this in the morning?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">nods curtly.</p>
  <p>Very well.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">still stares at Helia while giving Agata a slow sideways nod. He’s straight faced, but keeps eye contact.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">nods to Agata.</p>
  <p>We will get back on our watch.</p>
  <p>He starts back to the north gate.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>One moment, corporals. A word in your ear.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">steps in closer.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Loth</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">leads the bailiffs off deeper into the camp.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The twins, always sensitive to moments when they aren't being watched, run off too.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">slaps her head.</p>
  <p>You do not like giving me an easy life do you?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stands toward the back of the fracas, looking at their boots.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stands at full attention and stays quiet.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I have ten other fetches, yet spend most of my time running after you.</p>
  <p>Should it not be t'other way around?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">steps forward.</p>
  <p>You knew she was here questioning people?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>We saw two members of our team shouting and scared. We came to investigate.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>We came upon strangers bullying two of the men.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I am sorry for the misunderstanding, ma’am.</p>
  <p>After dealing with the Sparrow and knowing there’s spies in our camp, it seemed good to be sure.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I appreciate your concern for your fellow mercenary, but did you not see the warrant?</p>
  <p>We need to keep those bailiffs sweet, we're already on a rocky footing with our... clients.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">gives a nod and a grunt.</p>
  <p>We shall stay out of their way for rest of their time here</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I don't understand. Would it not have been sensible to tell us there were people looking for us in the camp right here that didn't need your permission to cart us off at their own leisure?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">raises an eyebrow at Orin.</p>
  <p>Not that you're first in my thoughts, Private Orin, but they just arrived an hour ago.</p>
  <p>I didn't think they'd get started before dawn.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>She is zealous.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">grunts at Ba.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">grunts and folds their arms.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns to Biron.</p>
  <p>Treason is a bit of a serious crime, Corporal.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">nods.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>And yet you know none was committed.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>We will stay away from them while they are here.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">nods.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Good idea. An even better idea is me returning to bed!</p>
  <p>Good night!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">gives a single nod to Agata and waits for her to leave.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Agata storms off into the camp, looking quite the sight in her nightgown and boots.</p>

<aside>
  <p>Chris says, <q>Did we have a short or long rest at all?</q></p>
  <p>Morgan, <q>Ooh, good question. Is it the next day or same night?</q></p>
  <p>Liam says, <q>Same night. We can’t have rested.</q></p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>Oh, yeah. Gritty rules.</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Another 24 hours without rest and you might gain exhaustion.</q></p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>What else is new? Lol.</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Lol, exhaustion is not Biron’s friend.</q></p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>What ya talking about? I love being exhausted, it’s like my FAVOURITE thing.</q></p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns to the others.</p>
  <p>Well, shall we get back to it?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>gives a grunt and single nod.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">starts heading toward the north gate.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">follows after Ba.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>One thing, if that sergeant has any north pride in her, she will be hard to fight off. We should avoid her.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">nods.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">goes back to his position on the outside of the wall.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">gives the nod, once everyone’s in position, and they set off again.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The party move along the perimeter of the North Camp, where the more veteran mercenaries stow.</p>

<p>It is a more staid affair than the East Camp; only a few, more grizzled folk smoke pipes, drink camp wine, and swap war stories around fires.</p>

<p>As they pass the northwest wall they approach the borders of Friar Wood.</p>

<aside>
  <p>Chris says, <q>Can I just check to see if there’s anything broken, like branches, etc? People moving through, maybe?</q></p>
  <p>Chris rolls 21 for Biron’s Wisdom (Survival) check.</p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>If ya wanted Perception it’d be the same number. Survival and Perception are +4.</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>I think either would’ve done in that situation.</q></p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">starts to feel uncomfortably alone on the wrong side of the barricades, with the dark trees so close hiding who knows what?</p>
  <p class="action">He glares out to the woods</p>
  <p class="action">He sniffs the air and listens closely.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>All seems very still on this side of the wall.</p>

<p>Biron stares deep into the woods, the strange feeling that something is looking back at him. Something, a shadow in a tree, watching... eyes glinting...</p>

<p>It hoots!</p>

<p>And Biron is startled as an owl flies off into the night sky.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">snarls.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Biron’s heart pounds in his chest. Otherwise, nothing seems untoward.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">narrows his eyes, but returns to marching.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">follows Ba by about 2 meters, trying to keep watch, but mostly kicking rocks and brooding.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">scans inside, occasionally looking to the others in the group.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>I think the South Gate was also missing some archers?</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>It was.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>But not the North Gate?</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>No, the North Gate was fully manned.</q></p>
  <p>Liam says, <q>Are only the gates manned?</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>The north towers are, even the ones not by a gate. But only a couple of the south towers are manned.</q></p>
</aside>

<p>The party continues past the North Camp, passing the Infirmary and arriving at the West Gate without event.</p>

<p>Only one of the towers seems manned here by a unit of archers.</p>

<p>They feel a shudder of the limepit somewhere out there, in the darkness beyond the lights of the camp.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">grunts.</p>
  <p>Anythin’?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">shakes his head.</p>
  <p>No all seems quiet.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>It's odd that one of the towers is empty, isn't it?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks up to the manned tower and back to the others.</p>
  <p>One moment, I'll go ask.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">waits.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks for a way to climb up.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>stands looking out to the limepit.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Ba sees a simple wooden ladder leading up to the tower nets.</p>

<p>The party passes the perimeter of the West Camp, largely empty as most of the forces involved in the push would've been camped here. That is, the soldiers not so green as to be a danger to themselves, or such veterans as to be wasted on such an enterprise.
Used to the bustle of the camp, the quiet is unnerving for Orin and Ba.</p>

<p>They pass the commissary, but by now it's so late even Sly Ben isn't holding court anymore and has retired to wherever Ben goes when he sleeps.</p>

<p>Perhaps a ditch somewhere?</p>

<p>Finally you arrive back at the South Gate.</p>

<h5>Scene V: Night 2</h5>

<p>The party are woken by the evening call for dinner, just a half-an-hour from dusk. Their stomachs growl, as they smell the evening meal waft from the mess. Smells like potatoes!</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>

<dt>Biron</dt>

<p>They both meet in the mess. The usual crowds of mercenaries sit together: the fetches, infantrymen, musketeers.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">grabs a plate of food, goes to the emptiest table, and sits quietly, ripping into the potatoes.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">scans the musketeers’ table looking for Lt Freya or Der Vynge.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Freya is away, but Der Vynge sits with the other musketeers murmuring amongst themselves. You notice the fetches seem especially agitated this evening. They speak in raised whispers amongst themselves.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">glowers at the other fetches and tries to listen what they are saying.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>Okay, so we’re fetches… What are the other categories of the company that have divisions in camp?</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>There are the fetches, Hyde’s fetches (who are considered a cut above the rest), the infantrymen, the archers (mostly privates and grunts), the musketeers (a law unto themselves), and the officers who eat with Captain Larke in the ruined manor house he has commandeered.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>Who’s The Hyde?</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Sergeant Hyde is an odious commander of an elite group of fetches. Agata is not a friend of his. Ba knows more.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>What makes those fetches elite?</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>They are favoured by Lieutenant Vins and they always seem to get results.</q></p>
  <p>Liam rolls 17 for Ba’s Charisma (Persuasion) check.</p>

<p>Ba never makes it up the ladder. As he emerges from the shadows and nears the tower an arrow flies at him from the shadows.</p>

<p>A number of arrows shoot out of the shadows of the nearby tents, all aimed at Ba. Two arrows fly for Ba, one to his shoulder blade and another at his calf.</p>

<p>Ba'Raknul catches one of the arrows and spins, throwing it back to where it came from.</p>

<p>Ba catches the blow that would've hit his calf and sends it back into the shadows. It hits something in the shadows with a hard thud.</p>

<p>The party hears a chilling but familiar squeal from the shadows!</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>

</dd>

<p>Orin can see something pale and small squirming in the dim shadows. Enough to train an attack on.</p>

<p>Orin takes a moment to watch the figure's moves before firing. They hold back, unable to see clearly and not wanting to give up their position.</p>

<p>On the other side of the barricade, Biron hears the sound of arrows flying and Ba grunting in pain.</p>
