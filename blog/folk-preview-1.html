<p>This variant attempts to do away with the problematic tropes of traditional, fantasy races. Instead, "innate" characteristics that were determined by your race are now determined by your folk <em>and</em> background:</p>

<p>A <strong>folk</strong> is a group of peoples united by a common culture. Yet within that culture many exceptions and variations exists. Like a D&amp;D race, a single folk contains multitudes: subcultures, kingdoms, factions, clans, tribes, courts or religious groups.</p>

<p>More important is your <strong>background</strong>. In this variant your background now determines your initial ability score increase. It also bestows a number of proficiencies and utility features that typically replace the utility <q>skill</q> feats, such as the Actor feat. This makes backgrounds receptacles of many of the <q>ribbon</q> or utility features or feats, allowing your to make more strategic choices for your characters, while still customising them.</p>

<p>When creating your character, replace step 1 with choosing a background and a folk for your character. An example background and folk are given below:</p>

<h3>Folk: Common Folk</h3>

<p>The most numerous peoples of the world, the men and women of the cities and rural areas. They till the fields, collect taxes, and wage wars upon one another. To the other folk this seems mundane, boring, even pointless. But none can deny the common folk have spread across the land, while older folk start to fade away.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Age.</dt>
  <dd>Common folk reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.</dd>

  <dt>Alignment.</dt>
  <dd>Common folk tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.</dd>

  <dt>Size.</dt>
  <dd>Common folk vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.</dd>

  <dt>Speed.</dt>
  <dd>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</dd>

  <dt>Versatile.</dt>
  <dd>You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice and you can increase one of your ability scores by 1.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Background: Entertainer</h3>

<p>You thrive in front of an audience. You know how to entrance them, entertain them, and even inspire them. Your poetics can stir the hearts of those who hear you, awakening grief or joy, laughter or anger. Your music raises their spirits or captures their sorrow. Your dance steps captivate, your humor cuts to the quick. Whatever techniques you use, your art is your life.</p>

</dl>

<h4>Speciality: Singer</h4>

  <dd>Ancient lore is often passed down through song, and you know more songs than anyone else you know. When making an Intelligence (Religion) or Intelligence (History) check you can instead chose spend 10 minutes singing an appropriate song you recall from your extensive repertoire of rhymes and ballads. When you finish you can make a Performance check instead. You can only do this once per short rest.</dd>
