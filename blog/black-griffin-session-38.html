          <p>In the <em>ninth</em> instalment of <span class="product">Black Griffin</span> the party interrogate their prisoners, learn little of the mysterious Commonwealth and acquire a new comrade-in-arms...</p>

<p>This campaign diary taken from the <q>in-character</q> chat channel from session 38 of my ongoing playtest campaign, lightly polished and annotated.</p>

<p>Black Griffin is a play-by-chat game that runs every week on Roll20. The party are mercenaries in the employ of the infamous Company of the Black Griffin. Lowly even for sellswords, they have been placed on punishment duty as company <q>fetches</q>: bounty hunters charged with capture of deserters for trial.</p>

<h5>Scene VIII: The Interrogation</h5>

<p>When we last left our baleful bounty hunters they had just interrupted a cadre of Flock spies overturning Ba'Raknul's tent. Tense combat ensued and Orin was badly wounded, but the spies were subdued.</p>

<p>Then a mighty crash! While the party were waylaid by the spies, more of the camp defences were sabotaged. This time a wall falls, leaving the camp exposed to the dark trees of Friar's Wood.</p>

<p>After some rest, our fetches decided to interrogate the spies. They make their way to the wine cellar cum camp prison in the heavily-guarded, ruined manor house that Captain Larke has commandeered.</p>

<p>As the party make their way there, they see a nervous looking fetch waiting.</p>

<p>Quinn stands around 5'8‚Äù tall and is slight of build. He has a nose slightly too big for his face, thick overhanging eyebrows, and squinting brown eyes which are too close together.</p>

<aside>
  <p>Ric, introducing our new player, Mark, and his character, Quinn, says, <q>Agata has ordered Quinn to meet with the rest of the party just outside Larke‚Äôs house. Quinn, Ba‚ÄôRaknul is your new Corporal.</q></p>
</aside>

<p>A thin, almost lipless mouth sits above a weak, clean-shaven chin. Black, slightly greying hair protrudes from a dark hooded cloak that has seen better days. The cloak is little more than a bundle of leather offcuts held together by filth.</p>

<p>He shuffles nervously from one foot to the next.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">looks behind themself to see what he‚Äôs looking at.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">approaches the fetch.</p>
  <p>Yes?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">glares at the fetch, standing beside Ba.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns to Ba'Raknul.</p>
  <p>We been sent to look for Corporal Ba'Raknul, squire... If ya knows him or could direct, would be grateful some!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">grumbles and takes a step forward...</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">snickers behind a sleeve.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>You are?</p>
  <p class="action">rests his hand by his axe and stares down at him.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">doffs a non-existent cap and bows slightly.</p>
  <p>The name‚Äôs Quinn sir. Quinn Wheatsteal. You be our Corporal?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">Looks Quinn over closely before pausing.</p>
  <p>Keep up and we'll fill you in after we've talked to the prisoner. This is time sensitive.</p>
  <p class="action">He moves towards the prison.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">grins nervously.</p>
  <p>Fill us in? What, like kill us?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Maybe.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">grunts and moves along with Ba.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>Sorry for the brief intro, I am Corporal Ba‚ÄôRaknul. Ba will suffice.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">grins at Ba.</p>
  <p>A pleasure to be meetin' ya, squire.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">tries on one of Biron's glares but can't keep a straight face.</p>
  <p>They cover by turning to catch up with Ba.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd><span class="action">whispering to Ba</span> Don‚Äôt like ‚Äòim.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>You still don't like me.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd><span class="action">whispering back</span> You don't like anyone.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>See?</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">snorts and keeps moving.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">starts to chuckle but ends up sucking their teeth and grabbing at their fresh wound.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks over his shoulder.</p>
  <p>There is no need for formality with me. As long as you don't get us killed and do your job, you're good. Him on the other hand‚Ä¶</p>
  <p class="action">He flicks a thumb towards Biron.</p>
  <p>‚Ä¶He'll take longer.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">turns around and walks backward so they can look at the new fetch.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks over towards Biron.</p>
  <p>Take longer to be good with, eh? Sure, I can win 'im over.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">ignores the small pest.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">rolls their eyes.</p>
  <p>Sure.</p>
  <p class="action">They turn around and continue on toward the makeshift jail.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks towards Orin.</p>
  <p>I ain't killed none, just up here trying to earn a crust. Man's gotta eat, good coin in war. Can earn a pretty crown or two.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">sighs.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">shrugs.</p>
  <p>What? You join for some noble cause or sommat? Can keep your causes in ya breeches. Can't eat high-minded ideals none!</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Ric says, <q>üê∂</q></p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">rolls his eyes back to the group.</p>
  <p><span class="action">barks</span> Get a move on, talk on your own time</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">growls.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>What's these prisoners done, then?</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Ambushed Ba. He's sore.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">keeps the pace up.</p>
  <p>They were in my tent. We need to know why.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The party, along with their new member, find themselves at Larke's digs. As they climb the steps, carefully treading over loose chunks of stone debris, to the grand entrance of the crumbling manor house, they find the way is blocked by two stern looking mercenaries. Judging from their scars and age, these are veteran members of Larke's elite guard.</p>

<dl>
<dt>The Soldier</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sneers as he looks you up and down.</p>
  <p>What do you bastards want?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">smiles.</p>
  <p>Agata sent us to talk to the captives.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">scratches at his stubble with the filthy nails of his right hand.</dd>

<dt>The Soldier</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">laughs.</p>
  <p>Ol' Aggie, huh? You must be fetches.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">remains quiet and holds up straight, with his normal unamused expression.</dd>

<dt>The Soldier</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns to his comrade.</p>
  <p>Ugly business, fetching. Not work for a true fighter!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">grumbles</span> Man's gotta eat.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">smiles again.</p>
  <p>And I suppose watching the rain is?</p>
  <p class="action">He chuckles as if laughing at his own joke, eyes on the soldier the whole time.</p>
</dd>

<dt>The soldier</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">growls.</p>
  <p>Watch your mouth, fetch!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">grins.</p>
  <p>Nah, they ain't just watching the rain none, Corporal. They be guarding against snow!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">gives an angry sideways glance towards Quinn.</p>
  <p>We're here to do a job. Can we get on with it.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>You must be hungry, Quinn. You keep talking about it an awful lot. Here.</p>
  <p class="action">They reach into their pack and toss some ration crumbs his way.</p>
  <p class="action">They turn to the guard.</p>
  <p>Whatever the job, it's all about how you end the day, isn't it?</p>
  <p class="action">They offer the guard their wineskin.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">scrabbles to catch the crumbs.</p>
  <p>Be rude to turn down food some!</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The soldiers each take swigs of the wineskin then begrudgingly raise their halberds and stand aside.</p>

<dl>
<dt>The Soldier</dt>
<dd>Straight the cellars, mind you! No exploring.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">nods.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">gives the guards and then Orin a single nod and walks in with Ba.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">nods and smiles again.</p>
  <p>Thank you very much.</p>
  <p class="action">He heads on past toward the cellars.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">leans in to Orin, grinning.</p>
  <p>Can't help finking those boys just called us thieves. Never been so offended.</p>
  <p class="action">He tries to keep up with Ba.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">narrows their eyes at Quinn before turning away.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The atmosphere inside the manor house is very different to the camp. The constant din of mercenaries doing their favourite thing, grumbling and complaining, dies out here. Servants bustle past you. The walls are adorned with paintings and tapestries, only some of which have been vandalised.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks around him whilst absently scratching at his crotch.</p>
  <p>Oh, very la-di-da. How the other 'alf live, eh? Reckon those paintings be worth a pretty crown.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">snarls.</p>
  <p>Touch them and lose your hands.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>In one room you spy several lieutenants sitting at a large table, heavy with fruits and wine bottles. At its head sits Vins, telling some bawdy tale. They don't even notice you pass as you take the stone steps into the cellar.</p>

<p>Down in the cellar it is very cold, and very dark.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">snorts.</p>
  <p>Just appreciatin' the art. Love a bit-o-paintin', me.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Shattered glass litters the floor, and grim men and women are chained to the low walls. The group are greeted by a grey-looking man, stooped and carrying an array of knives.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">stops and picks up a handful of shattered glass and keeps it in his hand.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stops before they go in and turns to Quinn.</p>
  <p>Listen, this is serious. We need not to be giving things away or letting the captives think we're disorganised. Don't speak out of turn please, while we are here.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">nods at Ba and looks sternly at the knives.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">turns and eyeballs the new one silently. He grunts and turns away to follow Ba.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">chokes on the dungeon stench. They cover their mouth and peer closely at each person chained to the wall.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">moves to the grey man.</p>
  <p>Okay.. You know who I am?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Grey Man</dt>
<dd><span class="action">nods sullenly.</span> What you want?</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>We're here to talk to the captives.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Agata's orders.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The man nods and leads you through a passage to another wine cellar, this one quieter than the last. Lit by a single torch sit three mercenaries chained to the walls: a lean looking woman, a young man, and an older man with streaks of grey in his long black hair and black beard.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Grey Man</dt>
<dd>These are Privates Wren and Lucas, and Corporal Eggard.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">grunts to Ba.</p>
  <p>Let me have the woman.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>With that, the grey man walks off, leaving you to your business with nary a word.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">quickly steps in front of Biron.</p>
  <p>We're just here to talk... for now.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">whispers at them.</p>
  <p>I have a plan. Just threats.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">raises an eyebrow.</p>
  <p>‚ÄòFor now‚Äô?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">stares at Orin and then just pushes them aside.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">raises an eyebrow at Ba.</dd>

<dt>Wren</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns to her compatriots.</p>
  <p>Say nothing! Leave the talking to me.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">looks at Ba, irritated, but backs off.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Private Wren bears the muscular physique of a heavy swordsman.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Wren, eh? Not your real name, is it?</dd>

<dt>Wren</dt>
<dd>Whose name would it be?</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">walks in and announces to the room.</p>
  <p>Look, this goes one of two ways: either he talks to you‚Ä¶</p>
  <p class="action">He motions to the large Biron holding a handful of glass.</p>
  <p>‚Ä¶or they do.</p>
  <p class="action">He motions to Orin holding their wine skin.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Not very smart, are you... Wren?</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">leans in to Ba</span> Fink it would be best to split 'em ser.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">nods.</p>
  <p>I think this ‚Äòprivate‚Äô has too much influence in here.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd><span class="action">whispers to Ba.</span> I have a way to make them talk</dd>

<dt>Wren</dt>
<dd>I ain't stupid. And I don't believe for one second we're getting out of our chains alive.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">gives Wren a cold look. There‚Äôs worse ways to die.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks back at the others, then back to Wren.</p>
  <p>Sorry, Wren... you know us fetches, we're hard to control.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Wren</dt>
<dd>Like I said, we ain't leaving these chains alive. And there is no way we're not going to get tortured either. You gonna double torture us to death, or summink?</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Aw, don't think like that. I'm pretty sure you are getting out of here alive, you know that?</p>
  <p class="action">turns to Ba and Biron and winks.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">steps between Biron and the chained captives.</p>
  <p>We ain't come all the way here to torture wretches chained to walls.  I'm sure the good lady here can be convinced otherwise...</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>Okay. Orin pop our lady‚Äôs chains. Biron have a chat, and I mean a chat, in the other room. Me and Orin will chat with these poor wretches.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">gives Ba a dark look. They walk over to Ba.</p>
  <p><span class="action">whispering</span> I don't think that's a wise idea? Certainly not as a first resort?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>If you could hold the door for us Quinn.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">nods and opens the door.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">walks over with Quinn and quietly talks.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">follows.</dd>

<dt>Ba‚ÄôRaknul</dt>
<dd>Listen. I am not okay with torture or even fear tactics and pressure. Understood?</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">leans against the door frame.</p>
  <p>Course, no need for everyone to be interrogated none. I'm sure the good lady here will be keen to sell out her underlings if that‚Äôs what they really are. Always our way innit? Shat on from above.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">growls.</p>
  <p>Traitors are traitors. They deserve nothing.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sniffs and winks at Biron.</p>
  <p>I'll go with you then, laughing boy, see if we can get some sense outta this one.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">rolls his eyes.</p>
  <p><span class="action">growling</span> Go get the keys</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">suddenly lights up.</p>
  <p>Couldn‚Äôt we just, erm... improvise keys?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>From the guard, idiot.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">waves his hand dismissively at Biron.</p>
  <p>I'm talkin' about future endeavours 'ain't I, chuckles?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">tries to mask his irritation while in the cell, but it slightly comes through.</p>
  <p class="action">He growls louder.</p>
  <p>Get. The. Keys.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sighs at Biron.</p>
  <p>Here.</p>
  <p class="action">They walk to Private Wren and pick the locks on her shackles.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">glances up at Orin as they do this.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">rubs at his jawline and whistles under his breath looking at Orin.</p>
  <p>Me and you are gonna get on just fine.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The crude shackles aren't difficult to pick and as Wren stands everyone is amazed at the sheer size of her. Ba and Quinn lead the seemingly fearless woman into another room.</p>

<p>The two men left behind seem more frightened than the junior officer.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">leads Wren to the next room. As they get in he pushes her to the ground.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">follows Biron. He reaches into the smelly tattered backpack at his shoulder.</p>
  <p>Got some old rope 'ere somewhere...</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">nods.</p>
  <p>Bind her legs.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">looks uncomfortable at Biron walking away with Wren, but turns back and gives the two remaining men long, hard stares.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">laughs at the men who seem more scared.</p>
  <p>Trust me, you'll have a much better time in here... providing you talk nicely with my friend here.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>What I said to Wren is absolutely true. You will get out of here alive.</p>

<dt>Eggard</dt>
