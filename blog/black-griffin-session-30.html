          <p>This is the first campaign diary for my 5th Edition D&amp;D playtest campaign, <span class="product">Black Griffin</span>. Black Griffin is a play-by-chat game that runs every week on Roll20. The party are mercenaries in the employ of the infamous Company of the Black Griffin. Lowly even for sellswords, they have been placed on punishment duty as company <q>fetches</q>: bounty hunters charged with capture of deserters for trial.</p>

<p>The below is an edited log from of our <q>in-character</q> chat channel. We've added annotations so you can follow what's going on. Please enjoy!</p>

  <h4>Camp Patrol Act I</h4>

  <p>After escaping the clutches of Royalist interrogators, our band of misfit fetches find their way back to the Black Griffin Encampment and spend a week unwinding.</p>

  <p>However, as you relax the rest of the camp is gearing up. The Company's Royalist clients are gathering forces for a push against the Commonwealth.</p>

  <h5>Scene I: The Debriefing</h5>

  <p>You awaken the next morn, ready to report to Agata for your debriefing.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd class="action">wakes early enough to finish off his new scar… added to the scars he already has, then heads over to Agata's tent</dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd class="action">doesn't move or make a sound from within their tent</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd class="action">rolls outta bed and stretches, gets his gear and, with no words, heads straight to Agata's tent</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The camp is restless as the regulars, artillery and officers prepare to move out. About you men and women are packing equipment, loading carts and moving heavy boxes of weapons.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd class="action">arrives outside Agata's tent, stands up straight and awaits for the other arrivals</dd>
  </dl>

  <aside>
    Liam says <q>Ba'Raknul is my character, a mysterious traveller from distant lands who possesses deadly skill with hand and weapons. His body is covered in ritualistic scars. He's currently the longest serving member of the party, and its unofficial leader.</q>

      <p>Can’t say I didn’t warn you <span class="action">and carries on</span></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd class="action">gives single grunt of acknowledgement as Ba arrives but says nothing</dd>
  </dl>

  <aside>
    Morgan says <q>The newest recruit, Orin is having trouble adjusting to their new environment. They still think of themself as a bowyer; the finest, in fact, in all the midlands.</q>
  </aside>

  <dl>
    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd class="action">Rolls out of bed still wearing their clothes and boots. They’re confused for a second but decide it's lucky since they don't have to get dressed. Stumbling out of their tent, they try to tuck in their shirt but somehow manage to only make it worse. They circle themself like a dog chasing its tail, trying to figure out what's gone wrong.</dd>
  </dl>

  <aside>
    Ric says <q>Corporal Loth is Agata's second-in-command. This tall, handsome man has never spoken a word as far as anyone in the camp can recall.</q>
  </aside>

  <dl>
    <dt>Loth</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">ducks out of Agata's tent, giving Ba and Biron a suspicious eye</p>
      <p>nods his head, as though to ask what you want</p>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd class="action">stumbles up behind Ba and Biron, wavering and blocking out the sunlight with an arm</dd>

      <p><span class="action">nods</span> We're here to report to Agata.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <aside>
    Chris says <q>Biron is my Barbarian character. Hailing from the North, he speaks straight, plainly and bluntly if required, preferring to use body language to get his point across (i.e. his axe).</q>
  </aside>

  <dl>
    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd class="action">rolls his eyes when he sees Orin but still says nothing</dd>

    <dt>Loth</dt>
    <dd class="action">rolls his eyes and opens the tent for you to enter
    </dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>
      <p><span class="action">nods again</span> Thanks</p>
      <p class="action">enters</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <aside>
    Morgan says <q>During their break, Orin spent their time trying to convince Agata to transfer them to the arms division and mourning River, the dog they were forced to leave behind in Dismas.</q>
  </aside>

  <dl>
    <dt>Loth</dt>
    <dd class="action">gives Orin a look of absolute contempt as they pass, his eyes flickering as though he can see something dancing about them</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd class="action">grunts towards Corporal Loth and follows Ba, steps into Agata's tent and stands up straight and in military style in front of her desk</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>You enter the now familiar and slightly comforting gloomy and smoke filled interior of Agata's tent.</p>

  <aside class="chat">
    Ric says <q>Sergeant Agata is the ageing and world-weary commander of the party. Nominally charged with hunting down deserters, Agata and her fetches now find themselves increasingly involved in the murky world of intrigue and espionage.</q>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>River was a traitor</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <aside>
    <p>Morgan says <q>When not pestering Agata, and often while pining after River, Orin was also investigating means of getting out of the Black Griffins. According to company law, you can buy your way out, but no one Orin spoke to has heard of anyone managing it.</q></p>

    <p>Ric says <q>There are no locked gates or guards keeping the mercenaries of the Griffin Company true to their contracts. All know that if they desert, fetches will be sent to arrest or kill them. And no one escapes the fetches.</q></p>

      <p>He was going to execute us then and there if I hadn't talked him out of it. Instead he drove us into the forest to see someone else, when we were ambushed by the Commonwealth.</p>

    <dt>Agata</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>It's rather your job to think on your feet in the field, and that's a shame. A physical description would set us all up for life. The Royalists pay dearly for any information.</p>

  <h5>Scene II: Lively Farm</h5>

  <p>You set off for the Livelys' farm, just as your compatriots set off for the great push. With grim determination, phalanxes of mercenaries march northward.</p>

  <p>You wave goodbye as they pass and they wave back, uncertainly. Perhaps this will be the last you will see of many of them, you ponder as you enter the sparse woods and trek towards the farm.</p>

  <p>The weather is grey, and turns into a light drizzle, not entirely unpleasant, cool even, especially for Orin.</p>

  <p>As you near the farm it is lunch and you all feel a great hunger.</p>

  <p>What do you do?</p>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>

      <p>At most.. we still need to make it back for night watch duty.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>You break and eat a portion of your rations each, while Orin warily watches the dripping woods about you.</p>

  <p>Nothing untoward happens until you finish your dry repast, when you hear a keen, high wailing in the distance, coming from the direction of the farm.</p>

  <p>It stops almost as soon as it starts, but you all shudder as though it suddenly got colder.</p>

  </dl>

  <p>Biron brushes away what little was left of the door and finds himself in what was once a family kitchen, now in disarray. Everything is broken, blood everywhere but... there are no bodies to be seen.</p>

  <p>The only thing of note is a pot of soup that has spilled onto its side, spilling the thin gruel across the floor.</p>

  <p>Biron’s door opens on what appears to be a pantry. Shelves filled with flour, pickles and various herbs. All strangely undisturbed... what kind of looters leave perfectly good food behind?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Ba opens a door on what must’ve been a bedroom. This room is filled with sacks of wool and feathers all piled up on the floor. Clearly this is where the Livelys must've slept together in one big pile.</p>

  <p>All is still and quiet.</p>
