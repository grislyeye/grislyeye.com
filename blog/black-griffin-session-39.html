        <p>In the <em>tenth</em> instalment of <span class="product">Black Griffin</span> the party interrogate their prisoners, learn little of the mysterious Commonwealth and acquire a new comrade-in-arms...</p>

<p>This campaign diary taken from the <q>in-character</q> chat channel from session 38 of my ongoing playtest campaign, lightly polished and annotated.</p>

<p>Black Griffin is a play-by-chat game that runs every week on Roll20. The party are mercenaries in the employ of the infamous Company of the Black Griffin. Lowly even for sellswords, they have been placed on punishment duty as company <q>fetches</q>: bounty hunters charged with capture of deserters for trial.</p>

<h5>Scene VIII: The Interrogation Continued...</h5>

<p>When we last left our foul-mouthed fetches they were busy furiously torturing agents of the Commonwealth. One captive, Eggard, agrees to confess on agreement he is given a writ a pass to return home. With all due haste, word was sent to Agata requesting such a writ. But Corporal Ba has perhaps bitten off more than he can chew; Sergeant Agata herself arrives with an entourage in tow.</p>

<p>With her is the lean, handsome, and solemn figure of Corporal Loth, and Walter the Scribe, company chronicler and bursar. The scribe is looking a little queasy. He is a thin, grey man in fine clothes, including a ruff and fancy shirt, most of which have seen better days. As per usual, he is splattered in mud.</p>

<p>The trio come up on the party waiting in the wide, bottle-lined corridor outside the makeshift cells.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Walter</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks in at the ghastly and bloody scene.</p>
  <p>By the Mother!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd><span class="action">to Ba</span> A word if you please!</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>Yes ser.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">stands to attention, silent.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">mutters quietly</span> Oh look, the la-di-da brigade have arrived...</dd>

<dt>Loth</dt>
<dd class="action">gives Quinn a sharp look.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">gives Quinn a filthy and disapproving look.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">doffs an imaginary cap and bows, smiling nervously.</p>
  <p>Sorry, m'lord. I mean to say we are graced by ya presence. Didn't mean nuffin by it!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">raises his top lip and lets out a quiet but low growl at Quinn.</dd>

<dt>Loth</dt>
<dd class="action">looks away, as though he heard nothing.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">winks at Biron and smiles.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>What's this I hear about a writ?</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">leans in.</p>
  <p><span class="action">hushed</span> Sorry ser, I wasn't demanding… we have one in there…</p>
  <p class="action">He motions to the other room.</p>
  <p>…saying he'll spill if he sees a writ. We thought if a fake one showed these two also might spill.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>And you propose we give him this writ?</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>I propose we write it in here, in front of these two so these guys can badger some more and then show him a writ.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">clears their throat from the corner.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>After he's told us everything we can absolve him of crimes here and hand him to the Royal Bailiffs for their crimes.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>Let me get this clear, Corporal. You want me to lie?</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">raises an eyebrow at Agata.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>No ser, it wasn’t my intention for us to lie. I thought it wouldn’t make any difference at this point if we're giving them to the Royal Bailiffs. If I stand corrected, I apologise.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Can be entirely true, if you have a problem otherwise. Won't matter because he'll never see the light of day after Helia gets him.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd class="action">rolls her pipe around her mouth, clearly uncomfortable.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>We need to know what they were after. This was their mission to get in with the Flock.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">scratches at his stubble.</p>
  <p>Hmm... don't seem right to offer him his freedom then deny it none.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>We're not denying him anything. He asked for the writ, not freedom.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">laughs without humour.</p>
  <p>But ain't the writ to grant him absolution for his crimes? Ain't never bothered with reading here, so wouldn't know.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">shrugs.</p>
  <p>Doesn't matter what it's for. Griffins don't have power outside themselves anyway.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>I might be a sell-sword. I might be a cold-blooded killer. I might be a right bastard. But I'm also a gods-fearing woman.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>My only other suggestion, ser, is talk to him yourself. See if you think the information is worth it.</p>
  <p class="action">He leans in toward Agata.</p>
  <p>Could you at least pretend to in front of these two so we can pressure them some more?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">coughs slightly in the dim hall, the smell of damp getting to the back of his throat.</p>
  <p>We could just force them to talk.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns towards the cell containing the unconscious form of Wren and puffs heavily on her pipe.</p>
  <p>We won't get much information knocking heads until our sources fall unconscious, Corporal.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">gives a nod and stays silent.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Look, ser. This was my idea. I came to it because you had already agreed we should send them off with Helia. How is handing him the writ first any worse?</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Very well. Loth!</p>
  <p>Clear a space for Walter to write!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Loth</dt>
<dd class="action">sweeps a nearby table clean with one swift action.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">turns and gives a nod to Orin and Quinn to begin pressuring the other two privates.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>Walter, take this dictation!</dd>

<dt>Walter</dt>
<dd class="action">lays out a sizeable array of quills, inks, and parchment, produced from somewhere in his ragged brocade coat.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>Shall I bring the one who talks?</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>Very good, Corporal Biron.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">gives a single grunt and nods, then walks in to get Eggard.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">gets close to Quinn.</p>
  <p>See if you can get Lucas in there to squeal before time runs out.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">nods to Ba, then turns to Quinn.</p>
  <p>Come along.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">leans in to look at the quills then turns back to Ba.</p>
  <p>Yesser!</p>
  <p class="action">He follows Orin, muttering.</p>
  <p>Must learn that fancy writing stuff at some point. Could come in handy.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">walks into the other cell with a dark shadow across his face. Looking down upon Eggard on the floor.</dd>

<dt>Eggard</dt>
<dd>What's going on out there?</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>Up.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">grabs the guy by the arm and pulls him up.</dd>

<dt>Eggard</dt>
<dd class="action">gingerly gets on his feet.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">places one hand firmly holding his arm and another on the back of his shoulder.</p>
  <p>Move.</p>
  <p>He marches him out of the cell to Agata.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>As Biron reenters the corridor with Eggard, Agata is standing over Walter, dictating the writ.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>Walter, write so: <q>By the order of Sergeant Agata of the venerable Company of the Black Griffin, I do hearby grant Corporal Eggard leave to forfeit the rights and purchases of his office, so that he may return home, on this day of our Mother and Father, 19th Ancept, 467.</q></dd>

<dt>Walter</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">hastily scribbles out the writ in near perfect calligraphy.</p>
  <p class="action">With a flourish he signs it, and passes it to Agata, who in turns adds her own X to the paper.</p>
  <p class="action">He rolls up the parchment, carefully pours wax from his wicker lantern, and seals it with his ring so it bears the arms of Griffin Company.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns to Ba and hands him the writ.</p>
  <p>It is done, may the Mother help us all.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">gives a strong squeeze to Eggard’s shoulder.</p>
  <p><span class="action">whispering coldly</span> Now, you tell us everything. Or that writ means nothing.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">takes the writ and bows low.</p>
  <p>Thank you Ser.</p>
  <p><span class="action">quietly to Agata</span> When will the Sergeant-Baliff be here?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>Do I look like her keeper, Corporal Ba? She'll be interrogating someone in the camp. Carry on, Corporal!</dd>
</dl>

<p>Agata marches out of the cellar, closely followed by Loth and Walter.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Eggard</dt>
<dd>Give me the writ!</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">pulls him hard and keeps him in place.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">gives Eggard a sharp look.</p>
  <p><strong>IF</strong> you tell us everything and <strong>IF</strong> it checks out. You get your writ.</p>
  <p>He leaves for the other room.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">growls behind Eggard.</dd>
</dl>

<p>While the writ is being written and signed, Quinn and Orin encourage the other captives to listen in from the other room…</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks over to the two captives and smiles sadly.</p>
  <p>Can't help thinkin' you've missed ya chance. Singing like a Kastenburg Canary that one. Always the problem with loyalty; it’s only worth something until someone breaks.</p>
  <p class="action">He walks over to watch the scene in the corridor.</p>
  <p><span class="action">looking back to Orin</span> You reckon that scribbling actually means anything? All looks like it’s been done too fast to me eyes.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">enters and motions to Orin to a corner.</p>
  <p>Orin can I have a moment please?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">peers at Lucas.</p>
  <p>Sure, Ba.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Mark whispers to Ric, <q>Quinn is trying to slip rations to the nearest prisoner. Does that need sleight of hand?</q></p>
  <p>Ric replies, <q>Yes, it will have to be Lucas. Wren is unconscious, if you recall.</q></p>
  <p>Mark rolls 11 for Quinn’s Sleight of Hand.</p>
  <p>Ric whispers to Morgan and Liam, <q>You notice Quinn slipping Lucas some of his rations out of the corner of your eye.</q></p>
  <p>Liam replies, <q>Okay, Ba notes it but stays quiet. He will watch but as long as it’s not an escape for Lucas he'll ignore it.</q></p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">crouches down in front of the two captives, pulls out a chunk of dried ration, and tears a mouthful with his teeth.</p>
  <p>He turns to look towards Ba' and Orin, chewing and holding part of his rations. He slips it to Lucas when he thinks the others aren’t looking.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">subtly shows the writ.</p>
  <p>We got it. there's two things I was thinking. I was thinking you would be best to talk to Eggard as he trusts you a bit already, but one of us needs to go get Helia as she's off somewhere in camp. I'm not sure how you wanna play the writ thing.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">stands and runs his greasy hands down his trews. With his back to the others, he motions sshhh to Lucas and winks at him.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>And we need to time it right as well.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Time it how?</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>So that we get all the info, but the Corporal doesn’t have time to actually dash.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>There's no reason we should give him the ability to dash. He doesn't get the writ until we get what we want. He should stay locked up until we're satisfied. He's not free until he gets the writ.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">nod and hands Orin the writ.</p>
  <p>Hide that and go have a word with Eggard.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">approaches Orin and Ba.</p>
  <p>So, what's the plan? It ain't handing them over to laughing boy is it?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns to Quinn.</p>
  <p>Me and you keep watching these keep the pressure up.</p>
  <p><span class="action">loudly</span> Orin is going to go have a chat with Eggard.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">salutes half-heartedly.</p>
  <p>Yesser!</p>
  <p class="action">He turns to look sadly at the captives.</p>
  <p>Don't fink this is gonna end well for ya, gotta say. Not too late to join your friend out there on the path to freedom though.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Lucas</dt>
<dd class="action">says nothing, just looks at Quinn with hopeless eyes.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">slips the writ into the secret pocket of their shirt, next to the note from The Sparrow.</p>
  <p><span class="action">quietly</span> I think I know how to make the switch. I'll show him the writ's in my pocket. When we're done, I'll show him I'm putting it in his pack. Except it won’t be the writ, it'll be the note from Sparrow.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">lights up.</p>
  <p>I love it. It’s horrible, but I love it.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Then all we have to do is tell Helia where to find him and to search his bag.</p>
  <p class="action">They start to leave, but think of something else.</p>
  <p>We'll tell her these two said they were working with him and he's about to get away, yeah?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">nods in agreement.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">nods and walks out.</dd>

<dt>Ba’Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">He leans in to Quinn and whispers.</p>
  <p>I understand helping a man in chains. Don’t let Biron see you-- and only food.</p>
  <p class="action">He moves and stands close to the captives, eyes on them.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">shrugs.</p>
  <p>I'm thinking they'll hang anyway.</p>
  <p class="action">He leans in to Ba and whispers.</p>
  <p>Won't hurt for them to think they have a friend in here with them, if you know my thinking.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">draws Eggard into the makeshift cell he was in earlier. They give Biron a strong look then look at the door and back at Biron again.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">stares at Orin dully.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sighs.</p>
  <p>Go on and lock him up if you must, but shut the door while we're talking.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">grunts aggressively. He pushes Eggard to the wall and chains him back up.</dd>

<dt>Eggard</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Wa... what's going on?</p>
  <p>Where is my writ?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">ignores him, stepping to Orin.</p>
  <p>You better be able to do this.</p>
  <p class="action">Without another word, he leaves and closes the door.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">pulls the writ from their shirt pocket, unfolds it, and puts it a few inches from Eggard's face.</p>
  <p>It's right here.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">stands outside both doors and stares through both bars.</dd>

<dt>Eggard</dt>
<dd>All well and good, but I'm not going to be doing much going home chained up like this.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">refolds the writ and puts it back in their shirt.</dd>

<dt>Eggard</dt>
<dd>I won't speak a word 'til that writ is in my unfettered hands.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>You haven't earned it just yet, Eggard.</dd>

<dt>Eggard</dt>
<dd>Neither have you earned my spilling of guts.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Ah, but see, we're the ones doing the buying.</p>
  <p>We don't have to get anything from you at all. We're entirely within our rights to shoot you dead. So, you give us what we're paying for. Then we pay you.</p>
  <p>Or we shoot you. Your choice.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Eggard</dt>
<dd>What's stopping you just shooting me, soon as I talk?</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>Can I do an intimidation roll here?</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>What do you hope to achieve by intimidating him?</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>Persuasion that we’re just as likely to kill him, just in case he’s getting the idea we want the information more.</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Okay, make a Persuasion check to see if he trusts you, difficulty class 15.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan rolls 9 for Orin’s Charisma (Persuasion) check.</p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Eggard, I've been completely straight-forward here. I said I'd get you the writ and here it is. I say I'll let you go, and I will. All these people here...</p>
  <p class="action">They gesture around the room and to the door.</p>
  <p>...they're keep me to my word.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Eggard</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">laughs.</p>
  <p>I heard you nearly kill poor Wren. You word ain't worth shit. Unlock my chains, put that writ in my hands, and I'll talk.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">barking</span> If he doesn't wanna talk, leave him for me.</p>
  <p class="action">He pushes his face against the bars of the door. Pushing hard against it, staring at Eggard hungrily.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks gravely at Eggard, then the floor, then sighs.</p>
  <p class="action">They go to the door.</p>
  <p>Biron, where's the man's pack?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Eggard</dt>
<dd class="action">looks fearfully at Biron.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">looks around for Eggard’s pack.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">walks to the door of Wren and Lucas’ cell, and leans up against it, straining his ears to see if he can pick up any of the conversation with Eggard.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Biron spies a pack in a corner of the adjoining corridor.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">grumbles and snarls as he paces like a caged lion before getting his meal. He picks up Eggard’s bag and starts to walk back with it.
Here.</p>
  <p class="action">He stops and looks at the bag. He thinks for a moment and opens it to look at what’s inside.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">scratches at his chin and looks at Biron.</p>
  <p>Looks like spoils of war that. Bout time we had a payday, if you take me meaning?</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The contents of the bag are much as can be expected of a mercenary’s bag: dry rations, pots and pans, a flint for lighting fires, bandages, a set of cards and what looks like a corn doll. Perhaps some kind of memento?</p>

<p>The old coins all have the heads of the current kings. With the surfeit of kings south of the Commonwealth border, no two are alike. Seems odd that a coin wouldn't have some noble blood's inbred profile stamped on them.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">leans over and studies the difference.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">peers at Quinn's coin.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks at the group and sighs.</p>
  <p>I wanted to say I'll go get the twins but with Biron in this state I'm hesitant to leave. We need to make sure Birno isn’t alone with these guys at any point.</p>
  <p class="action">He looks at Orin and Quinn.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>Toss a coin?</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">picks one of the captives’ coins up and tosses it to Ba.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">catches the coin and laughs.</p>
  <p>Not what I meant.</p>
  <p class="action">He tosses it back.</p>
  <p>You haven’t met Helia before.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Oh, well I meant send Quinn.</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
Mark whispers to Ric, <q>So that was all the coins from the captives purse (minus the one Ba had) but plus 6 of my own gold coins. Not sure if anyone picked that up lol.</q>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">pushes all the coins on the floor into the captive’s coin purse and puts it back in the pack.</p>
  <p>He flinches as the coin bounces off his head.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>I suppose, though I didn't figure her difficult to find, I can go find the twins and send them if you like.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>I will go to Helia directly. You and Quinn release our boy and watch Biron. Two of you might fair ok.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">grimaces.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks up from the floor.</p>
  <p>If it be dangerous, wouldn't it be best to take someone with?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>It’s dangerous for you, not me.</p>
  <p class="action">He laughs joyfully.</p>
  <p>You'll have Biron.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">grumbles</span> Join a mercenary group, they said. Get rich, they said. Earn a name for yourself...</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">can't laugh at this and looks injured at Ba.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks to Orin.</p>
  <p>What? Look I don’t doubt your skills, but I doubt we all could take Biron on one of his bad days.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>That's what I'm afraid of.</dd>
</dl>

<p>To be continued...</p>
