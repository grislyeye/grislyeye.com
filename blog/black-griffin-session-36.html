          <p>In the <em>seventh</em> instalment of <span class="product">Black Griffin</span> the party find themselves attending a war council and a new enemy makes their presence felt...</p>

<p>This campaign diary taken from the <q>in-character</q> chat channel from session 36 of my playtest campaign, lightly polished and annotated.</p>

<p>Black Griffin is a play-by-chat game that runs every week on Roll20. The party are mercenaries in the employ of the infamous Company of the Black Griffin. Lowly even for sellswords, they have been placed on punishment duty as company <q>fetches</q>: bounty hunters charged with capture of deserters for trial.</p>

  <h5>Scene VII: Night 2 Continued...</h5>

  <p>As you may recall, our band of barbaric arms-bearers not only uncovered and killed foul orcish saboteurs, but managed to prove their existence to a disbelieving Agata.</p>

  <p>Now, summoned to her tent in the Griffin Encampment, a war council of sorts is being convened...</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Agata</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Private, corporals. It appears we have a new adversary...</p>
      <p>Creatures thought... long dead prevail still. The so-called orcs, or night folk, not only appear to dwell amongst us, but wish us ill.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd class="action">stands tall and silent, a dark look upon his face.</dd>

    <dt>Agata</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>We must protect the camp at all costs! And this includes keeping the existence of these creatures from the rank-and-file. For nothing can kill a company faster than desertion!</p>
      <p>And that is the one thing we are mandated to prevent!</p>
      <p>With this in mind, I am giving you command of a unit of light infantry.</p>
      <p class="action">She nods towards the private standing to attention, who salutes in return.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd class="action">looks incredulous.</dd>

    <dt>Agata</dt>
    <dd>You will double patrols with these forces to prevent further sabotage until we can understand the nature of what we're up against.</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd class="action">looks over to the private and snorts.</dd>

    <dt>Agata</dt>
    <dd>Any questions?</dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">coughs</p>
      <p><span class="action">softly</span> Are we entirely certain that these creatures aren’t working with our enemies?</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd class="action">gives a sideways glance at Ba and growls.</dd>
  </dl>

  <aside>
    Ric whispers, “Biron and Ba notice that Agata now has a filthy copy of the Dictum, the Holy Book of the Mother and Father, open on her desk.”
  </aside>

  <dl>
    <dt>Agata</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Corporal Ba, the very question itself in insensible. Do I think the Commonwealth is working with foul beastmen to undermine the Royalist cause?
        Anything is possible, which is exactly why I have no idea if that is true or not.</p>
      <p>What do you think?</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd class="action">pauses and thinks hard for a moment.</dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd>it's awful convenient if they aren't.</dd>

    <dt>Ba’Raknul</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>I think the common folk see and hear way more than we do... Everywhere I have gone on missions the commoners, whether enemy or bystander, knew of strange creatures or ‘myths’. I wouldn’t put it past someone like Sparrow to even trick these creatures into working for them.</p>
      <p>A well placed lie or false information leaves us a target, which is good for them however you slice it.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">growls.</p>
      <p>The beasts die like any man. We kill them and move on.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd><span class="action">rolling their eyes</span> Of course that's your opinion, Biron.</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">snarls at Orin.</p>
      <p>We have been given a job. Lets move on with it.</p>
      <p class="action">He returns to his upright, face forward position.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd>Yeah, except the job wasn't 'go kill', it was 'protect'.</dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>I wouldn’t get into the difference there with Biron.</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd class="action">rolls his eyes at Orin’s naivety.</dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd>I don't suppose he knows it.</dd>

    <dt>Agata</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Enough squabbling!</p>
      <p>The dying of them is not what concerns me. The ones that remain do. Legends speaks of vast hordes of these creatures. Do such numbers remain? And if so, why have we not seen them before.</p>
      <p>And why are we seeing them now?</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd class="action">shudders as his mind flashes back to the warrens.</dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd class="action">fidgets with the cork on their wineskin.</dd>

    <dt>Ba’Raknul</dt>
    <dd>I would speculate we are seeing them now because they’re nearly ready to do something big. Big enough that revealing themselves is no longer an issue.</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">looks at the book Agata was reading.</p>
      <p>What do we know of them?</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Agata</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">nods.</p>
      <p>A concerning proposition, Corporal Ba.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd>They? As in those squealing pig-things that couldn't speak a word?</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>It’s possible.</dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>They may speak a way we don’t hear. You remember Old Spit?</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">thinks for a moment.</p>
      <p>It’s possible they might have been forced from hiding. Whether directly or indirectly.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">appraises Biron.</p>
      <p>Exactly. They don't strike me as intelligent enough for machinations.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>You don’t need to be intelligent to form a plan or be wise enough to lead... Maybe a new leader has risen. Someone that has the ability to gather and organise these things.</dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Those...</p>
      <p class="action">They swallow hard.</p>
      <p>...rats... they were smart, you could see it in the way they fought us.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>Beasts fight to their habitat. These creatures knew to run and hide to try to get by us. They used distraction.</dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd>Or they were just squealing cowards.</dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>That’s not it Orin. It listened to our words. They’re not as dumb as you are thinking.</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd class="action">steps towards the light infantry private, looking him over, ignoring the child like rambling of Orin.</dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Maybe. Maybe they have an intelligent caste... maybe they fart fairy dust. This is all just speculation anyway.</p>
      <p class="action">They kick at the dirt floor.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">sighs.</p>
      <p class="action">He gives the new man a solid looking over.</p>
      <p>In any case we should get moving... I would like to talk to these guys before we start... learn their skill and how best to deploy.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">looks back at Agata.</p>
      <p>We will get this done.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>Agata, if that is all?</dd>

    <dt>Agata</dt>
    <dd>One more thing: we need another of these... things. Alive. So we might... question them. Or at least, examine them.</dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd class="action">glances sideways at Biron.</dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Do you have some shackles? They’re slippery creatures.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Agata</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">hastily scrawls a writ on a peace of paper.</p>
      <p>Take this to the commissary, they'll give you what shackles you desire.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">nods.</p>
      <p>Thank you, ser.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Agata</dt>
    <dd>Good luck and... be careful out there. Dismissed!</dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd class="action">nods at Agata and walks out.</dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd class="action">salutes and leaves.</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd class="action">gives single nod and grunt, then follows.</dd>
  </dl>

  <aside>
    <p>Ric says, <q>Do you guys have access to the playtest supplement The Many in your player’s pack? The stat block for the unit you now command is on page five. Basically, six light infantry soldiers, but they work as a whole.</q></p>
    <p>Chris says, <q>Are they lined up already?</q></p>
    <p>Ric says, <q>Yep, standing three wide and two deep.</q></p>
  </aside>

  <p>Outside, the private leads the party to the unit they have been given command over. The six light infantry stand to attention and like most mercenaries, they’re a bit shabby round the edges and green in the tooth (one woman cannot be older than 16 summers), but they are armed and trained.</p>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>Now let me show you a maneuver or two.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Ba and Orin find their way to the commissary. This large tent is the store of food and supplies for the camp.
    As always, Sly Ben and his drunken cohorts hold court outside, lounging around on barrels and stools.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Sly Ben</dt>
    <dd>Ba! You scabrous scoundrel!</dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd class="action">nods at Sly's mates with familiarity.</dd>

    <dt>Sly Ben</dt>
    <dd>What do you want with Ben?</dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">nods and hands over the paper.</p>
      <p>We need some shackles, please Ben.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Sly Ben</dt>
    <dd class="action">takes the writ, eyeing it warily before shrugging and passing it to the youngest drunk.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The boy grumbles and disappears into the large tent, pulling back the entrance to reveal large shelves filled with food, weapons and other equipment.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Sly Ben</dt>
    <dd>While we wait, sit a while! Have a drink!</dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">smiles cheerfully.</p>
      <p>Please!</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">shakes his head.</p>
      <p>No thanks.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Sly Ben</dt>
    <dd>Good old Ba! Never knowingly fun!</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The joke is even weaker than the ale passed to Orin, but Ben's court laugh as though it were the funniest thing they've ever heard.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">chuckles.</p>
      <p>They lean back and drink their ale with gusto.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd class="action">waits patiently, watching Orin for any slips, knowing how sly Ben is.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Meanwhile, the boy reappears carrying manacles, which he holds out for Ba to take.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">takes the manacles.</p>
      <p>Thanks. Let’s go, Orin.</p>
      <p class="action">He turns and leaves hurriedly to meet the others and make the patrol.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd class="action">shrugs at Sly Ben, then downs their drink before heading off with Ba.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The rowdy sound of Ben's drunken companions disappears into the general noise of the camp as dusk approaches.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd class="action">heads straight off to find Biron and the infantry so they can go to the South Gate and take over the watch.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The party and their new unit assemble at the South Gate just as dusk falls, exactly on time for once. They’re greeted by the surly day watch.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>The soldier</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Day watch is over! And we didn't lose a single tower!</p>
      <p class="action">He laughs at his own jest, joined by his fellow day watch men and women in a cruel laugh.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>
      <p><span class="action">growls</span> If you did, you wouldn’t notice.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd>You probably never knew where they were in the first place.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>This causes a small giggle to break out from the light infantry unit. The day watch slink off, caught off guard, to lick their wounds.
    Meanwhile, the unit the party commands stands to attention.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>The soldier</dt>
    <dd>What are your commands, sers?</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">looks to Ba.</p>
      <p>We found the creatures first to the north.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd class="action">thinks a moment.</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>They attacked from the north side as well.</dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>That could be a ruse.</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>

    Morgan says, “Actually, I think the unit is effectively a swarm-type creature. They attack multiple times, but take damage as a whole, with a single armor class and one pool of HP.

  <dl>
    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>Groups of three with a twenty-foot spread... Never mind. Let’s stick together. But maybe Biron take a twenty-foot lead, and Orin try to stay hidden from apart from the main group. If we are attacked you can locate them.</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd class="action">growls and nods.</dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd class="action">Sure thing.</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>Have Orin in back. Me, you, infantry, Orin.</dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>I’ll take the rear. I am the fastest to catch up if needed.</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>Fine, ok. So it’s me, Orin? Infantry, Ba?</dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd>You, infantry, Ba... Orin's elsewhere.</dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>Yes.</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">nods.</p>
      <p>Let’s go east first this time.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>The soldier</dt>
    <dd>Er... sorry to interrupt sers, but Agata specifically commanded that we double the patrols. That is, we should take two separate patrols.</dd>

    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">smiles.</p>
      <p>Is that so?</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>In which case we go left, you go right. We meet at north and south.</dd>

    <dt>The soldier</dt>
    <dd class="action">salutes.</dd>

    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Wait.</p>
      <p class="action">He takes out his fire prepped arrow and tells them how to signal danger.</p>
      <p>Be safe.</p>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">growls at the men.</p>
      <p>Remember what we trained. Stay quiet and kill quick. Signal any of the manned towers.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>The soldiers</dt>
    <dd class="action">nod and salute, clearly ready to prove themselves to their northern commander.</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">gives a single nod and grunt.</p>
      <p>Go.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>So the groups’ night patrols begin. Everyone’s nerves are on edge, and the darkness beyond the barricades weighs on their minds. Despite the fact, the first patrol around the camp goes without mishap, putting them even more on edge. Will the creatures come again? What are they waiting for? Yet the party meets the infantry unit with nothing for either group to report.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>growls and slowly listens to the night. He smells the air and holds his battleaxe in one hand.</dd>

    <dt>Ba’Raknul</dt>
    <dd>moves slowly in the dark, bow ready.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>However, on the second patrol, as the party passes the fetch camp, they hear a rustling... coming from Ba's tent!</p>

  <aside>
    <p>Ric says, “What light sources do you have?”</p>
    <p>Chris says, “Inside the camp? Isn’t it lit with firelight, etc?”</p>
    <p>Ric says, “At night, the camp is mostly in darkness. Sporadically lit, and less so in the fetch camp.”</p>
    <p>Morgan says, “Orin hasn’t got anything out, they’re being sneaky.”</p>
    <p>Chris says, “Biron would have a torch out.”</p>
    <p>Liam says, “I have a torch.”</p>
    <p class="break"></p>
    <p>Ric says, “Make stealth checks, please. Anyone carrying a light source is at disadvantage.”</p>
    <p>Morgan rolls 8 for Orin’s Dexterity (Stealth) check.</p>
    <p>Chris rolls 7 for Biron’s Dexterity (Stealth) check.</p>
    <p>Liam rolls 19 for Ba’s Dexterity (Stealth) check.</p>

    <p>Chris rolls 3 for Biron’s Initiative.</p>

    <p>Liam rolls 14 for Ba’s Deflect Missiles feature.</p>
    <p>Liam rolls 15 for Ba’s Deflect Missiles attack.</p>
    <p>The cloaked figure takes 7 piercing damage!</p>
    <p class="break"></p>
    <p>Ric says, “You are each joined in melee by a cloaked figure. Two more hold back to shoot arrows.”</p>
    <p class="break"></p>
    <p>Liam rolls 9 for Ba’s Spear attack.</p>
    <p>Liam rolls 18 and 11 for Ba’s Flurry of Blows attack.</p>
    <p>The cloaked figure takes 5 bludgeoning damage!</p>
    <p class="break"></p>
    <p>Morgan rolls 13 for Orin’s Shortbow attack.</p>
    <p class="break"></p>
    <p>Morgan says, “Sorry Chris, why would I attack the ones that aren’t engaged in combat with anybody?”</p>
    <p>Chris says, “Biron’s just yelling orders, you can decide otherwise.”</p>
    <p>Morgan says, “I mean, if it’s sensible, I’m all for it.</p>
    <p>Chris says, “My experience, always deal with the ranged people first.”</p>
    <p>Morgan says, “But as is, that would have me doing half damage and provoking them to attack me. I don’t disagree, but Biron or Ba would be better for that.”</p>
    <p class="break"></p>
    <p>Chris rolls 8 for Biron’s battle-axe attack.</p>
    <p class="break"></p>
    <p>Ba takes 6 slashing damage!</p>
    <p>Biron takes 4 slashing damage!</p>
    <p>Orin takes 8 slashing damage!</p>
    <p>Morgan says, “Oh hell.”</p>
    <p>Ric says, “How many hp has Orin got left?”</p>
    <p>Morgan says, “4.”</p>
    <p>Chris says, “Oh wow, how so little?”</p>
    <p>Morgan says, “Level 3 rogue, lol.”</p>

      <p>He stumbles up and across the tent.</p>

  <p>Inside the tent is... empty! It's been ransacked, Ba’s papers and equipment scattered around.</p>

      <p class="action">rushes back out of the tent.</p>
      <p>It's em-</p>

  </dl>

  <p>Suddenly, the team hears the telltale sound of an arrow being readied. A flurry of arrows fly out of the shadows around you, one goes for Ba’s chest, two strike Biron's arm, and one catches Orin in the flank. The source appears as cloaked figures hiding in the shadows, just out of range of Biron's lamp light.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd class="action">ROARS!</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Three of the cloaked figures draw their swords and close in, joining each party member in melee combat.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd>They're out here, Ba!</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Biron deftly catches the arrow and, with one flick of his wrist, sends it flying into the shoulder of one of the approaching figures. They grunt in pain, but join Ba in combat.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd class="action">beats his chest.</dd>

    <dt>Ba’Raknul</dt>
    <dd class="action">switches to his spear and unleashes a strike at the creature. Then, focusing his ki, he kicks out twice.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>They easily sidestep Ba’s spear thrust, but his kick catches them hard in the shin and they stumble, gnashing their teeth in pain, blood pouring from the arrow wound.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">agilely avoids engaging with the swordsman after them, and runs into the tents.</p>
      <p>They turn around and launch an arrow at the one Ba damaged.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Orin narrowly misses a swipe as they easily evade the cloaked figure's opportunistic attack, sending an arrow flying. However Orin’s target is ducking and diving fast to avoid Ba's blows and the arrow goes wide.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">roars with anger and beats his chest hard.</p>
      <p>COME AT ME!</p>

      <p><span class="action">shouting to Orin</span> Warning arrow! Then deal with the archers before...</p>
      <p class="action">He shouts at top of his booming voice.</p>
      <p>DANGER!</p>

  <p>The cloaked figure sidesteps Biron’s clumsy axe swing. A smile flashes under the hood, teeth missing.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd class="action">snarls, leering towards the hooded 'face'.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The sword-bearing figures slash at Ba and Biron, and Orin's assailant closes the distance to slash at them. Clearly skilled, the fetches fend off the blows but they all get many cuts and bruises, and even a couple of slashes for their trouble.</p>

  <p>The two archers in the back send arrows into the melee, but both miss.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd class="action">curses and strikes again.</dd>

  <p>Ba slams his spear into his assailant, piercing his chest and burying it in the ground beneath. The man dies instantly, still standing, supported by the odd angle of the strike.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd class="action">moves to help Orin, moving to another and trying to kick them.</dd>

  <p>Ba misses, landing a kick in another tent, disturbing a sleeping fetch who roars in shock.</p>

    <dd>
      <p class="action">shouts in pain as the sword hits them.</p>
      <p class="action">They run into the tents again, holding onto their wound tightly, to hide in the darkness.</p>

      <p class="action">He roars at them.</p>

  <p>Biron’s slash into the guise of his assailant cuts a deep gash in their abdomen. The hood slips revealing a woman’s face... someone he recognises! A fellow mercenary, a corporal from around camp.</p>

    <dt>The cloaked figure</dt>

      <p>For the Folk!</p>
      <p class="action">She grunts at you before trying to strike back.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd>YOU!! TRAITOR!!!</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The two swordsmen strike back at Ba and Biron, but the tide of battle has turned. The glint of doubt enters their eyes and their strikes become flawed and easily dodged.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, an arrow strikes Biron.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">swings his spear above his head, bringing the wooden handle down hard onto a pressure point on his assailant’s neck.</p>
      <p>He attempts to strike the cloaked figure in the throat.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Ba strikes in a flurry of spear thrusts and blows, but the figure takes a step back and leans away, just missing them.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd>moves slowly, making their way around to aim another arrow at Biron's attacker.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>In this darkness, amidst the tents, Orin just can't get a straight line on their foes. Another arrow misses, landing in a tent pole.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Orin</dt>
    <dd class="action">swears quietly, then ducks back into the shadows.</dd>

    <dt>Biron</dt>
    <dd class="action">roars and leaps around the shadowy figure, trying to grab them around the neck with his arm.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Biron's corded muscles rippling, he easily overpowers his assailant. He drops to the ground, taking the struggling figure with him.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Biron</dt>
