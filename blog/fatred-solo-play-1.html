        <div class="content">
          <p>This is a tale of Fair Paralain, that rotten tooth of a city. It is a story of kings and princesses, catamites and fairy knights. A tale of misfortunes and gallows humour.</p>

<p class="preview"><strong>True Queen</strong> is a series of solo play-throughs using <span class="product">Fate Condensed</span> and <span class="product">The Mythic GM Emulator</span>. (To help me come up with scenes and situations). I'm using the series as a way of familiarising myself with the system, for a forthcoming one-shot.</p>

<h3 id='setting'>Setting</h3>

<p>Following the instructions for <a href='https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/game-creation'>game creation</a> in <span class="product">Fate Core</span>, I started with the campaign issue aspects. The setting is a low fantasy, and <span class="fate aspect">Magic Wanes As Superstition Waxes</span>. Spellcasters are rare, and keep a low profile lest they become the target of angry mobs.</p>

<p>The kingdom is in the grip of the <span class="fate aspect">Motley Coup</span>. Nubbin, the court jester, was always erratic. Now madness grips him and spreads to the king’s men. The nobility are being rounded up for who knows what grisly end.</p>

<p>I’m also adding a genre aspect, <span class="fate aspect">Grim Realities And Bleak Outcomes</span>. A <em>genre aspect</em> sets the tone for the world. It works like <a href='https://fate-srd.com/fate-system-toolkit/genre-aspects#quest-aspects'>quest aspects</a> from the <em>Fate System Toolkit</em>. It can be compelled to create grim complications and horrific situations. When it does so, all players get a fate point.</p>

<p>Next, we devise the faces and places. The important NPCs and locations relevant to the scenario. I’m adding Paralain and Nubbin:</p>

<div id="city-illustration" class="outlined illustration">
  <img src="/images/city.png" alt="City Illustration">
  <p class="caption">Public domain illustration of Genua from the <span class="product">Nuremberg Chronicle</span>, 1493.</p>
</div>

<h4 id='paralain'>Paralain</h4>

<p>The city of Paralain is built on a tall, spire-like tor. Its <span class="fate aspect">Streets Are Steep And Buildings Precarious</span>. <span class="fate aspect">Thieves Run Rampant</span> on its streets, and beggars cry for alms at every street corner. </p>

<h4 id='nubbin'>Nubbin</h4>

<p>This <span class="fate aspect">Sadistic Jester</span> is the prancing rabble-rouser of the <span class="fate aspect">Motley Coup</span>. He wears a jester’s garb. It’s skin tight, as he is <span class="fate aspect">Oddly Ripped</span>.</p>

<h3 id='characters'>Characters</h3>

<p>Next comes character creation. A couple notes first: I switched up the default skills for a fantasy setting. And I’m using the optional <a href='https://fate-srd.com/fate-system-toolkit/skill-modes'>skill modes</a> rule from the <em>Fate System Toolkit</em>. I’ll also be playing with my Gifts Extra. You can download my custom rules <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BnnA9VnbN2MRqighnCMVRhz1s2Ne6LYp?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<p>This is a low-powered campaign, and skill are capped at Good (+3). I’m also using the rule for <a href='https://fate-srd.com/fate-system-toolkit/genre-aspects#low-powered-aspects'>low-powered aspects</a>, to make things as difficult as possible for my characters.</p>

<h4 id='princess-allayne'><a href='https://fatecharactersheet.com/character/fate-condensed/jN66-IQ19/alayne-princess-of-doors'>Princess Allayne</a></h4>
<p>The hero (?) of our tale is the acerbic Princess Allayne, an indolent princess who spends her days and nights carousing in a most unladylike fashion. She has Leader Fair (+2) and Fighter Average (+1) as her roles.</p>

<h4 id='lothlorn'><a href='https://fatecharactersheet.com/character/fate-condensed/x7Ip9aYSj/lothlorn'>Lothlorn</a></h4>

<p>Lothlorn is an elvish knight, banished from Faerie for a crime he can no longer recall. Cursed not to speak by the <span class="fate aspect">Tongue Tied Curse</span>, he is sworn to protect Allayne. She is a princess, after all.</p>

<p>He has Fighter Fair (+2) and Gifted Average (+1) as his roles. His gift is Chicanery: his lies take on an illusionary life of their own. In addition, if he successfully hits with his silver sword he can create a free Average (+1) illusionary advantage. He starts the game with no fate points, using his Chicanery to hide his fey nature for the entire scenario.</p>

<h4 id='willan-the-say'><a href='https://fatecharactersheet.com/character/fate-condensed/UVRgMVBhm/willan-the-say'><strong>Willan the Say</strong></a></h4>

<p>Willan is a street catamite, who is <span class="fate aspect">Down And Out On His Luck</span>. He’s tangentially a member of the group, having recently latched on Lothlorn.</p>

<p>He has Leader Fair (+2) and Knave Average (+1) as his roles. His stunt boosts his core skill: Provoke.</p>

<h3 id='game'>The Game</h3>

<p>We start the game with a Chaos Factor of 5. Using the emulator, I make a roll to determine what happens in the next scene. I have a scene in mind, but I roll a 4 on a d10, below the current Chaos Factor. This means we get an interrupt scene:</p>

<h4 id='scene-1'>Scene 1: Saphraim</h4>

<p>The scene starts in the <q>Fumble With The Maid Inn</q> (or just <strong>The Fumble</strong>). The PCs are involved in a strange game of chance with the mysterious Saphraim.</p>

<div class="fate card">
  <h5>The Fumble</h5>

  <p><span class="fate aspect">Knaves and Whores</span></p>

  <p><span class="fate aspect">Noisy and Distracting</span></p>

  <p><strong>Zones:</strong> Bar, Main Room, Mezzanine.</p>
</div>

<div class="fate card">
  <h5>Saphraim</h5>

  <p><span class="fate aspect">Mysterious Gambler</span></p>

  <p><span class="fate aspect">Intoxicating Pipe Smoke</span></p>

  <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Empathy Good (+3), Lore Good (+3), Spirit Good (+3), Deceive Fair (+2), Contacts Fair (+2).</p>
</div>

<section class="chat">

  <aside>
    I starts the scene with 3 fate points.
  </aside>

  <dl>
    <dt>Saphraim</dt>
    <dd>Let's raise the stakes, shall we?</dd>

    <dt>Willan</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">licks his lips.</p>
      <p>I'm in!</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Allayne</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">leans forward.</p>
      <p>Aye! What are the stakes?</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Saphraim</dt>
    <dd>An hour of your time, for one hundred crowns.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>I compel Willan's <span class="fate aspect">Down And Out On His Luck</span> aspect. Willan needs the coin. Badly. Despite the high stakes, he's willing to risk </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Willan</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">eyes go wide.</p>
      <p>You jest.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Saphraim</dt>
    <dd class="action">shakes her head, smiling.</dd>

    <dt>Willan</dt>
    <dd>I'm in.</dd>
  </dl>

  <aside>
    Lothlorn rolls Average (+1). I roll Terrible (-2) for Saphraim. He spends a fate point to invoke the <span class="fate aspect">Noisy and Distracting</span> aspect for a +2. With Deceive Good (+2), Saphraim's result is Fair (+2).
  </aside>

  <p>Lothlorn attempts to discern if Saphraim has a tell. This is an opposed to check to Create Advantage for <span class="fate aspect">Tell</span>. He fails, and is much disturbed that Saphraim remains impervious to his acute, fey senses. There must be more to her than meets the eye...</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Lothlorn</dt>
    <dd class="action">raises an eyebrow.</dd>
  </dl>

  <aside>
    <p>Willan rolls Poor (-1) with Deceive Fair (+2), and invokes his <span class="fate aspect">Down And Out On His Luck</span> for a Good (+3) result.</p>

    <p>I roll Good (+2). He spends another fate point to invoke <span class="fate aspect">Noisy and Distracting</span> for a +2. With Deceive Good (+2), Saphraim's result is Fantastic (+6).</p>

    <p>Saphraim succeeds with style, so I determine Willan takes a 2 shift hit to his mental track. He uses a mental stress slot to absorb 1 shift, and takes the <span class="fate aspect">Disturbed</span> mild consequence.</p>

    <p class="break"></p>

    <p>Chaos Factor: 6</p>
    <p>My Fate Points: 3</p>
  </aside>

  <p>Willan plays a hand, but loses. He now owes Saphraim one hour of his time... no doubt a price more deer than it first seems. Willan seems shaken at the prospect.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Saphraim</dt>
    <dd class="action">smiles knowingly.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>I end the scene here. As the results seem ambiguous, I increase the Chaos Factor.</p>

  <h4 id='scene-2'>Scene 2: Bar-room Brawl</h4>

  <p>I intended for <strong>Nubbin</strong> to burst into the inn in the next scene and start a brawl. But I roll a 1 against the Chaos Factor: it's odd, so I make a scene alteration. I roll on the emulator event table. The alteration is <q>NPC action</q>. For prompts, I roll <q>Disrupt Power</q> on the event meaning table, and interpret this as Nubbin sneaking up on the PCs, rather than bursting in.</p>

  <div class="fate card">
    <h5>Nubbin</h5>

    <p><span class="fate aspect">Sadistic Court Jester</span></p>

    <p><span class="fate aspect">Oddly Ripped</span></p>

    <h5>King's Men</h5>

    <p><span class="fate aspect">Bloodlust</span></p>

    <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Fight Fair (+2), Shoot Average (+1).</p>

    <p><strong>Taste of Blood Stunt:</strong> Gain an extra shift harm on your first hit in combat.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Suddenly, Allayne feels a hand slap on her shoulder. She turns around to see Nubbin, with a retinue of king's men.</p>

  <aside>
    <p>Lothlorn rolls Fair (+1) to Create Advantage. He adds Provoke Fair(+2) for a result of Great (+3). The King's Men roll Poor (-1). I invoke their <span class="fate aspect">Bloodlust</span> aspect, for a total of Average (+1). Lothlorn wins, and creates the advantage <span class="fate aspect">Hesitant</span> for the King's Men.</p>
  </aside>

  <dl>
    <dt>Nubbin</dt>
    <dd>
      <p><em>He he he.</em></p>
      <p>You are cordially invited to dinner, princess.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Allayne</dt>
    <dd>Ugh, don't call me that!</dd>

    <dt>Lothlorn</dt>
    <dd class="action">stands up, posing threateningly</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Lothlorn successfully intimidates the king's men. They take a couple of steps back, leaving an opening for Lothlorn.</p>

  <aside>
    <p>Lothlorn now has 1 fate point.</p>

    <p>Lothlorn rolls Mediocre (0) and adds Fight Good (+2) and +2 for his free invoke, for a score of Great (+4). The man he's targeting rolls a Poor (-1) and adds his Fight Fair (+2), for a total of Average (+1). A success with style! Lothlorn takes out his opponent, and gains a boost, <span class="fate aspect">Blocking Allayne</span>.</p>

    <p class="break"></p>

    <p>Combat begins. Since Lothlorn has the surprise, he goes first. He rolls Good (+2). With his Fight Good (+2) and free invoke of his boost, this gives a result of Fantastic (+6). Nubbin rolls Average (+1). He uses his stunt, which allows him to substitute his Provoke Good (+3) for Fight in combat. I also invoke his <span class="fate aspect">Oddly Ripped</span> aspect, for a total of Fantastic (+6).</p>

    <p>It's a tie! I decide it's a success with minor cost: no damage, but Lothlorn gains a boost against Nubbin: <span class="fate aspect">Off Foot</span>.</p>

    <p class="break"></p>

    <p>Lothlorn now has 2 fate points.</p>

    <p class="break"></p>

    <p>Lothlorn hands off to Allayne, and then Willan, in the exchange. They both try to create the advantage <span class="fate aspect">Behind Cover</span>. The difficult is set at Average (+1). Willan rolls Average (+1) and adds his Athletics Average (+1) for a success. Similarly, Allayne rolls Fair (+2) and succeeds too.</p>

    <p>The exchange must be handed over to the king's men now. They all attack, two on Lothlorn and one each on Allayne and Willan:</p>

    <p>Kings's Man #1: 0 + 2 Fight vs Lothlorn 0 + 2 Fight - Tie!</p>

    <p>Kings's Man #2: -1 + 2 Fight vs Lothlorn 0 + 2 Fight - Fail!</p>

    <p>Kings's Man #3: 0 + 2 Fight vs Willan 0 +1 Athletics +2 free invoke - Tie!</p>

    <p>Kings's Man #4: -1 + 2 Fight vs Allayne 0 + 1 Fight+2 free invoke - Fail!</p>

    <p>The King's Men gain the boost: <span class="fate aspect">Press Advantage</span>.</p>

    <p>Nubbin rolls Average (+1). With Fight Fair (+2) and invoking the boost, he gets Superb (+5). Lothlorn rolls Mediocre (0) for a result of Fair (2). He 3 shifts of physical stress.</p>
  </aside>

  <p>Rather than leave it there, however, I offer Lothlorn a compel on his <span class="fate aspect">Sworn To Protect Allayne</span> aspect. Fearing for Allayne's life, Lothlorn takes no chances and attacks. He shoves one of the king's men, knocking them into a table. They take the hit hard, and go down. With the advantage, he manoeuvrers to shield Allayne.</p>

  <dl>

    <dt>Allayne</dt>

    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>I compel Lothlorn's <span class="fate aspect">Tongue-Tied Curse</span> trouble aspect here (he needs the fate points). In the frenzy, Allayne misses his gesture.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Allayne</dt>
    <dd class="action">hides behind the table, oblivious to Lothlorn's signal.</dd>

    </dd>

    <dt>Nubbin</dt>
    <dd class="action">produces a bloody cleaver and swings it at Lothlorn's pretty face</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Lothlorn dodges it, taking a shallow slash to his arm. Meanwhile, Willan seizes the distraction to pick up a chair and throw it through the window, to create the advantage <span class="fate aspect">Handy Exit</span>. It is a trivial thing to do, and Willan easily succeeds with success. He takes out the window and some of the poorly constructed wall.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Willan</dt>
    <dd class="action">jumps through the window into the alleyway outside</dd>

    <dt>Allayne</dt>

      <p>Save your princess, drunken curs!</p>
      <p class="action">she commands the tavern patrons</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Allayne creates the <span class="fate aspect">Someone Is Always A Hero</span> advantage using one of the free invokes from the <span class="fate aspect">Handy Exit</span> aspect, and her Noblisse Oblige stunt. Given the drunken and indifferent nature of the knaves inhabiting the Fumble, the difficulty is set at Good (+3). With the invoke, she succeeds with Great (+4)... just. The patrons surround Nubbin and his men, delaying their pursuit.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Lothlorn</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">follows</p>
      <p class="action">he throws crate at window to block exit</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The difficulty for this is set at Fair (+2) and Lothlorn rolls Fair (+2): a success at cost. Instead of blocking the door, the crate goes through the opening towards Nubbin. He creates the boost <span class="fate aspect">Crate Flies at Nubbin's Head</span>.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Allayne</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">frantically looks around for an escape route</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Allayne rolls Poor (-1) and uses the free invoke from <span class="fate aspect">Someone Is Always A Hero</span>: Nubbin is preoccupied pushing away knaves and whores and rolls Terrible (-2). Even with his Notice Average (+1) he misses where Allayne looks... she creates the <span class="fate aspect">Alleyway Escape Route</span>.</p>

  <aside>Willan now has 2 fate points.</aside>

  <p>Seeking to prolong the scene even more, I attempt to compel Willan's <span class="fate aspect">Down And Out On My Luck</span> trouble, but Willan spends a fate point to avoid this.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Willan</dt>
    <dd class="action">throws a dagger at one of the pursuing king's men.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>It's a bold attempt, and he uses the free invoke from <span class="fate aspect">Someone Is Always A Hero</span>. A patron attempts to hold the target. But Willan rolls terribly.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Willan</dt>
    <dd class="action">misses.</dd>
    <dt>King's Man</dt>
    <dd>
      <p class="action">elbows patron in the face.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Outside, Lothlorn attempts to use his Chicanery gift. He attempts to create the illusion of the party running in the opposite direction.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Lothlorn</dt>
    <dd class="action">gestures wildly down the street, then turns in the other direction.</dd>
  </dl>

  <aside>Lothlorn now has 3 fate points.</aside>

  <p>However, I compel the <span class="fate aspect">Magic Wanes As Superstition Waxes</span> genre aspect. Lothlorn accepts: the illusion fails, and Lothlorn becomes confused as he sees illusions of the party running in every direction.</p>

  <p>The party concede the fight: they escape, but Lothlorn leaves a <span class="fate aspect">Trail Of Blood</span> in his wake.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>Fate Condensed</em> was fun to run. I bounces: you&#39;ll jump from situation to situation, in a breeze.</li>

  <li>The simple and elegant mechanics of aspects + skills + stunts makes it really easy to make NPCs, locations, anything you can think of.</li>

  <li>Despite the simplicity of aspects and skills, actually running the game can be quite noodly. It&#39;s not always immediately obvious whether you should be rolling to overcome, create an advantage, etc. And I was constantly looking up the various outcomes for each action... they&#39;re subtly different.</li>

  <li>The <span class="product">Fate Condensed</span> book was not enough to run the game, and I found myself referring to the more detailed rules in <span class="product">Fate Core</span>. The action descriptions for individual skills was a particularly glaring omission.</li>

  <li>The <em>Mythic GM Emulator</em> seems a bit redundant with <span class="product">Fate Core</span>. Compels, invocations, and fail-forward resolutions drive the story forward without the need to refer to a random decision maker.</li>

  <li>The Chaos Factor rule from <em>Mythic GM Emulator</em> seems to do the opposite of what I expected: you get more interrupt scenes the closer you get to the end-game, which breaks pacing.</li>

  <li>I found it hard to run mental combats. I need to find some examples of this to get a better grip on these.</li>

  <li>Using the optional rules for low powered play worked really well. It gave me the right mix of narrative adventure, with gritty consequences.</li>

  <li>Online tools for <em>Fate</em> are amazing. In particular, the <a href='https://fari.app/dice'>Fari Online Dice Roller</a> and the <a href="https://fatecharactersheet.com/">Fate Character Sheet</a>.</li>
