    <h3>Join our Playtest Campaign</h3>

    <p>We're looking for imaginative players to join our official, playtest campaign and give us your feedback. This will be a <strong>play-by-chat only</strong> game using 5th edition <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.</p>

    <p>As playtesters you'll get access to pre-release material to review. Plus <strong>free</strong>, digital copies of the final products when they are released. Double plus: we'll immortalise you with a playtest credit! Can't say fairer than that.</p>
