<p>We wanted to share with you some of the early sketches from our upcoming monograph from Grisly Eye Games, <strong>Threats: Vermus</strong>. Our artist, George Howard, is really capturing the wretchedness of the rat men. See what you think:</p>

<p>For centuries the vermus have lurked in the undercity sewers unbeknownst to the citizens above. But soon their wretched existence may be revealed&#8230;</p>

<p>This monograph will be part of <strong>Grisly Eye Games&#8217;</strong> Threats Series. Each monograph will introduce new, setting-neutral monsters to supercharge your <strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong> campaign.</p>

<p><strong>Threats: Vermus</strong> introduces the vermus, a low-level monster for 1st to 2nd level characters. It includes a detailed description of the nature and culture of the vermus, 3x monster statistics (CR 1/4 to 1), campaign notes and adventure seeds.</p>
