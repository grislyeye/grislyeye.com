<p>A **skill challenge** is a complex type of skill contest, based on the rules from 4th Edition <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.</p>

<p>Like combat, a skill challenge is divided into rounds. Unlike combat, each "round" could be seconds, days, weeks or even years of game time. Each round the Dungeon Masters goes around the table in no particular order and asks each player what checks or spells they would like to use. Once everyone has decided what they are doing, the players make the appropriate rolls. The Dungeon Master keeps a count of the number of successful and failed checks.</p>

<p>Repeat the process until either the party:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Succeeds</strong> by accumulating the required number of successful checks, or</li>
  <li><strong>Fails</strong> by failing 3 checks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each challenge lists the checks and spells that can be used, but these are not meant to be exhaustive. Dungeon Masters should encourage players to be creative with the skills and spells they use to overcome the challenge.</p>

<p>The Land is at war, but it is like no war before it. Where once battles were won by courage and sharp blades, secrets and lies are now deciding factors. The ability to extract information from unwilling prisoners is vital. In addition to arsenals or pistols, infantry and armour, modern armies also have spies and interrogators skilled in the arts of torture.</p>

<p><strong>Success (3):</strong> You gain the information you desire.</p>

<p><strong>Failure:</strong> You gain incorrect or misleading information. If the target dies of exhaustion you do not gain the information you want. You may stop the skill challenge at any time and allow the target to rest. If you retry interrogating the same target later, your failed checks transfer to the new skill challenge.</p>

<p><strong><em>Charisma (Deception or Intimidation) vs target's Wisdom:</em></strong> By keeping the target awake and asking hard or tricky questions, you can find out additional information. You must make this check with disadvantage. Each time a creature uses this check the target looses a level of exhaustion.</p>

<p><strong><em>Strength (Athletics) vs target's Wisdom:</em></strong> By torturing the victim you can more easily acquire information. Each time a creature uses this check the target looses <em>two</em> levels of exhaustion.</p>

<p><strong><em>Torturer's Tools vs target's Wisdom:</em></strong> With judicious use of torturer's tools, you can cause maximum pain with minimal actual physical damage. Each time a creature uses this check the target looses a level of exhaustion.</p>

<p><strong><em>Spells</em></strong> Casting <em>charm person</em> grants an automatic success.</p>
