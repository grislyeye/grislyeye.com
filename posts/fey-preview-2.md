<p>These are some fey-themed spells I've been working on, mainly relevant for social encounters as part of my forthcoming monograph, <strong>The Fey</strong>. This book will include new fey-based subclasses, spells, races and monsters for low-fantasy campaigns.</p>

  <h5>Fey Guide</h5>
  <p>*2nd-level enchantment (ritual)*</p>
</header>

<p>**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Touch<br/>
**Components:** V, S, M (a small token that must be worn by the target of the spell, i.e. the feather of a red robin)<br/>
**Duration:** 1 day</p>

<p>A creature you touch gains immunity to the effects of Feywild Magic, including memory loss and time warp, for the duration of the spell. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fey.</p>

  <h5>Forget</h5>
  <p>*1st level enchantment*</p>
</header>

<p>**Casting time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Touch<br/>
**Duration:** Instantaneous<br/>
**Components:** V, S</p>

<p>You attempt to erase the memory of a humanoid. The target of the spell must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature is hostile to you, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw, it permanently forgets the last minute from the moment you cast the spell. Any changes to itâ€™s disposition that occurred in the last minute are are also forgotten and reversed.</p>

<p>*At Higher Levels.*  If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the target forgets up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the target forgets up to 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the target forgets up to 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the target forgets up to 1 year.</p>

<header>
  <h5>Heart's Desire</h5>
  <p>*1st level divination*</p>
</header>

<p>**Casting time:** 1 bonus action<br/>
**Range:** 30 feet<br/>
**Components:** V</p>

<p>You attempt to read the heart's desire of a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails the saving throw you learn something about the target. This reveals a single piece of useful information about the target as chosen by the DM. This could be an ideal, bond, flaw or similar personality characteristic.</p>

  <h5>Speak with Small Beasts</h5>
  <p>*Divination cantrip*</p>
</header>

<p>**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Self<br/>
