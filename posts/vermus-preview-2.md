<p>Continuing <a href="/vermus-preview-1.html">our series</a> of posts about the vermus, we introduce the wracks:</p>

<p>The ratfolk's hardy constitution make them resistant to diseases. However, sometimes them succumb to plagues but do no die. Instead, they live on as foul <em>wracks</em>.</p>

<p>Delirious with fever, eyes rolling, fur wet with sweat, mouths foaming. The ravings of wracks are considered sacred by the vermus. It is thought their feverish mental state allows them to commune with dark spirits and gods of pestilence. At once holy men and pariahs, the vermus care for them but keep them muzzled and chained. In times of need they work them into a frenzy to release against their foes.</p>

<p>These wretches accumulate diseases like a miser collects coin. They then act as carriers. Left unchecked, they can spread plague across whole cities.</p>
