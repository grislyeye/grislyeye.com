<p>
  In this variant, the magic that enchants most magical items is tainted in some
  way. These flawed magic items give a penalty to creatures who use them. This
  rule is for low magic campaigns where magical items are rare, and makes the
  use of magical items a more strategic choice.
</p>

<p>
  Flawed magic items are not considered cursed: a creature can identify a magic
  item’s flaws in the same way they can identify it's other properties.
  Attunement with flawed magic items can also be ended normally.
</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<header>
  <h5>Toxic potion of healing</h5>
  <p><em>Potion, common </em></p>
</header>

<p>
  You regain 2d4 + 2 hit points when you drink this potion. You must also
  succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage and
  become poisoned. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving
  throw. If you succeed the poison wears off. The potion’s red liquid glimmers
  when agitated, with strange green swirls.

        <strong>Hallucinogenic.</strong> When you drink this potion you also
        start to hallucinate a nightmarish creature. The DM determines what you
        hallucinate and where the hallucination appears (normally a hostile
        creature you can see). You must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw
        or you become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened by this potion,
        you must take the Dash action and move away from the hallucination by
        the safest available route on each of your turns, unless there is
        nowhere to move. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the
        saving throw. If you succeed you stop hallucinating and are no longer
        frightened.
