<p><em>Non-player characters</em> (NPCs) are the lifeblood of any D&amp;D campaign, but I often find descriptions in published adventures aren't particularly accessible. Often, important details are hidden in dense paragraphs.</p>

<p>As I work on my own adventure campaign, <span class="product">Black Griffin</span>, I started to develop a format for NPCs based on the monster stat block. The stat block is a fantastic piece of design, displaying quite dense information elegantly. Here is my versions of it for NPCs:</p>

<p>The NPC block starts with the name of the NPC, followed by a short, physical description of the NPC you can read out to your players. The following sections are based on three most important pieces of information you need (IMHO) when running NPCs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Characteristics.</strong> Obvious things</li>
  <li><strong>Secrets.</strong> Non-obvious things</li>
  <li><strong>Escalations.</strong> Things they could do</li>
</ul>

<h4>Characteristics</h4>

<p>The NPC block uses the background characteristics (ideals, bonds, flaws, etc.) from the <em>Player's Handbook</em>. These are great for detailing the "obvious" stuff about NPCs. They are displayed first, making it easy for DMs to start playing the character.</p>

<h4>Secrets</h4>

<p>All good NPCs have something to hide, and the <q>Secrets</q> section details these. Each secret should have a <em>tell</em>, something observant PCs might notice about the NPC to figure out their secret. A tell is accompanied by one ore more passive checks, normally Perception, but could also be some other lore-based skill, like Religion or History.</p>

<p>I make these passive checks in secret, and pass notes to the players when they succeed. My players love getting secret insights they can roleplay.</p>

<h4>Escalations</h4>

<p>The hardest part about running NPCs is figuring how to use them to <em>drive</em> the action. Escalations attempt to fix this by presenting some examples of things the NPC could do next. Maybe they'll arrest the characters? Or throw a feast in the party's honour?</p>

<p>When the action is flagging a bit, check off an escalation and run it.</p>

<h4>Future Work</h4>

<p>The above NPC block is for a non-combat NPC, but it would be trivial to mix the NPC block and monster statblocks for combat-based NPCs.</p>

<p>I also think some of the terminology could be refined. For example, not all mysterious elements of an NPC might be <q>Secrets</q>. And <q>Escalations</q> is a terrible word. Maybe <q>Deeds</q> would be better?</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions on how to improve the NPC block let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/grislyeye/status/976139172267397120">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/85tqi8/proof_of_concept_stat_block_for_npcs/">Reddit</a>.</p>
