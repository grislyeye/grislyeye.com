  My new monograph, The Eldritch. This gorgeous 12 page monograph introduces
  five new backgrounds and variant rules for low-fantasy characters.
</p>

<p>The new backgrounds are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>The Auspicious</strong>. You were born under a mystic sign, a rare
    and auspicious circumstance, giving you a gift for magic.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>The Cursed</strong>. To put it simply, you have been cursed by
    powerful magic. Perhaps you did something to deserve it. Maybe you were a
    victim of circumstances. Whatever the reason, you are now a pariah.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>The Gift Bearer</strong>. You carry a gift that bestows magical
    powers. You might be a young thief who inherited a magical box, or a hedge
    knight who found a legendary sword.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>The Immortal</strong>. You are one of the rare immortals, perhaps
    the only one (you know of). You are vulnerable to mortal harm but do not age
    and have lived centuries.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>The Occultist</strong>. You are part of a hidden conspiracy that has
    access to forgotten magics and a mysterious purpose. In exchange for
    swearing oaths of loyalty and secrecy you have received mystical knowledge,
    thought long lost.
  </li>
</ul>
