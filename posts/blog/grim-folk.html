<h4>Grim Folk Traits</h4>

<p>Grim humans traits are the same as the standard human traits in the <em>Player's Guide</em> except where listed here:</p>

<p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your ability scores each increase by 1.</p>

<p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Humans reach adulthood in their late teens, but few live long enough to see 50 summers.</p>

<p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Humans vary widely in height and build, from 4 feet to barely over 5 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.</p>

<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>

<p><em><strong>Frail.</strong></em> Life is hard and few folk are left untouched by its ravages. You gain a frailty based on your lowest physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity or Constitution). See the Frailties table below.</p>

<p><em><strong>Sinful.</strong></em> Humanity is imperfect in mind and body, but their true weaknesses are spiritual, not physical. You also gain an additional flaw. You can roll or choose this from the Sins table below.</p>

<p><em><strong>Versatile.</strong></em> You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.</p>

<p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write Common.</p>
