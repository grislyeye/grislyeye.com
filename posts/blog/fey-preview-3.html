<p>{{ previewStart }}This is a new monster template for sidekicks I've been working on as part of my forthcoming monograph, <span class="product">The Fey</span>. This book will include new fey-based subclasses, spells, races and monsters for low-fantasy campaigns.{{ previewEnd }}</p>

<p>Legends are full of encounters with magical woodland animals that can speak and think. Families of mice collecting berries for jam, cats in boots and singing toads. The idea seems whimsical, but these fairy creatures have their own agendas and any who encounter them should be on guard against their fey trickery.</p>
