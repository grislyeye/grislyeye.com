<p class="preview">In the <em>12th</em> instalment of <span class="product">Black Griffin</span> in which the party is court-martialed for assaulting an officer...</p>

<p>This campaign diary taken from the <q>in-character</q> chat channel from session 41 of my ongoing playtest campaign, lightly polished and annotated.</p>

<p>Black Griffin is a play-by-chat game that runs every week on Roll20. The party are mercenaries in the employ of the infamous Company of the Black Griffin. Lowly even for sellswords, they have been placed on punishment duty as company <q>fetches</q>: bounty hunters charged with capture of deserters for trial.</p>

<h5>Scene X: The Court Martial</h5>

<p>Last we heard from our band of sellswords they had just been caught brawling by a senior officer, the hard- (and hawk-) nosed Lieutenant Vins. Second only to the Captain of the Black Griffins himself!</p>

<p>Now the party finds themselves chained in the same cellars beneath Larke's ruined manor where they were interrogating prisoners just moments ago, awaiting court marital.</p>

<p>Walter the Scribe appears in his ridiculous periwig. As always, mud spatters his fine clothes and he is attended upon by one of his thin and wiry clerks.</p>

<p>He turns to Ba first.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Walter</dt>
<dd>Name?</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">fumbles with his chains.</p>
  <p>Ba Raknul.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Walter</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Rank?</p>
  <p class="action">confers with his clerk.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>Corporal.</dd>

<dt>Walter</dt>
<dd>You have been charged with assault of a senior officer. How will you be pleading?</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">goes from staring sullenly at the floor to suddenly glaring at Walter.</p>
  <p>What senior officer?!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks confused.</p>
  <p>Not guilty, I didnt touch anyone and I'm the most senior member here.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Walter's clerk whispers in his ear.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Walter</dt>
<dd>I believe there was an affray with a... Corporal Biron.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">clears his throat</span> Beggin' ya pardon squire... but it was only old Quinn here that did any assaulting, so to speak. My friend Orin here shot an arrow at me, by way of warning and it   have accidental like hit the other guy - but it was only me with intent like.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Corporal Biron was doing the assaulting.</p>
  <p>And even so I never touched anyone.</p>
  <p>I was ready to stop it should it go further.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Walter</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">the Scribe raises his hand.</p>
  <p>You'll have to take that all up with Lieutenant Vins. I don't decide these matters, just record them for the Company Charter.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>Not guilty then.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns their glare to Quinn.</p>
  <p>What are you burning talking about, Quinn?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">also glares at Quinn.</p>
  <p>Don't add more things to their list.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Ridiculous things!</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>They have no humour.</p>
  <p>For these things.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">shuffles in his chains</span> Oh, beggin' ya pardon squires - thought we were talking of other   like. Forget old Quinn if you would. The cold northern air has got to me brain.</dd>

<dt>Walter</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Yes, I'd listen to the Corporal here. Less said is better when it comes to Vins.</p>
  <p class="action">the Scribe turns to Biron.</p>
  <p>Name? Rank?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stands tall, his chains shaking.</p>
  <p>Corporal Biron.</p>
  <p>Guilty.</p>
  <p class="action">plods back down with a thud in silence.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Walter</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Ah yes, I remember you <q>corporal.</q> All that nasty business in Whiterock.</p>
  <p class="action">Turns to Orin.</p>
  <p>Name? Rank?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">goes back to staring at the floor.</p>
  <p>Private Orin.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Walter</dt>
<dd>How will you be pleading?</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sighs.</p>
  <p>Not guilty.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Walter</dt>
<dd class="action">murmurs something to his clerk, who is furiously making notes in the dim light.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">nearly laughs.</p>
  <p>Don't think to hard about the justice system... it only hurts.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Walter</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Of course, we all recall that mercenaries are notorious for never lying.</p>
  <p class="action">rolls his eyes and turns to Quinn.</p>
  <p>Name? Rank?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">goes to doff his non-existent cap before his hands stop him</span> Quinn Wheatsteal, guvnor - private so I am.</dd>

<dt>Walter</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">the Scribe raises his eyebrow.</p>
  <p>A sellsword with manners? Well I never.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">smiles and looks off into the distance.</p>
  <p>Ah, me ma - the mother bless her soul. She always used to say to me 'Quinn, respect ya...</p>
</dd>

<dt>Walter</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">the Scribe coughs.</p>
  <p>Yes, well, how do you plead, Private Wheatsteal?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">lets out a deep sigh.</p>
  <p>I guess seeing as you ain't gonna be lied to none, I may as well take me lashes up front. Think old Quinn here is to blame for all this nonsense. Since I've arrived I've taken the pleasure of winding up my friend Biron here - probably a little too much. He don't mean nothing by it - he's a good man. But Quinn's got a big mouth, ya know? Guess I'll be pleading guilty on behalf of all of us, if ya take me meaning.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">shifts uncomfortably in their chains, but says nothing.</dd>

<dt>Walter</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Are you sure about that? Brawling is merely a fining offence. Assaulting a senior officer, or just being involved. That's a flogging.</p>
  <p>And your... friend here... seems to want to take the blame.</p>
  <p class="action">Gestures to Biron.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">sighs again</span> Well, I ain't never been good at lying none - and if I let him take my beats he'll make my life hell.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">grunts angrily.</p>
  <p>I failed. I should be punished.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>I mean you understand, I don't mean nuffin by it - just was having a bit of fun. Pushed me luck a bit too far some I reckon.</dd>

<dt>Walter</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sniffs.</p>
  <p>I'd let him take the fall.</p>
  <p><span class="action">whispers:</span> He's just a Northener.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">mutters under his breath</span> Tempting as that may be, old Quinn values his teeth. Don't suppose there be any lenience for an old fool who's new to the job like?</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">whether he hears the remark or not, goes back to staring at the wall.</dd>

<dt>Walter</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stares blankly at Quinn.</p>
  <p>No.</p>
  <p class="action">pinches the bridge of his nose.</p>
  <p>Again, I'm not the one who needs convincing. You'll be called up soon, so I suggest you spend the time getting your strategy and story straight.</p>
  <p>Now, I have other mercenaries to speak to about their court martials.</p>
  <p>Good day!</p>
  <p class="action">He struts off, clerk scuttling after him.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">smiles</span> Seemed like a reasonable enough man.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">kicks the floor as Walter leaves, once he's gone.</p>
  <p>He's a coward... he can go burn.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">is silent.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns to the rest of the room.</p>
  <p>Okay I can stress this enough,... keep it quiet while we're out there... no quips, clever lines... unless you want extra punishment.</p>
  <p>They don't care about whats fair.</p>
  <p>They care what they think happened.</p>
  <p>Play along, don't annoy anyone and we'll get by okay.</p>
  <p>Other than that its on you... I warned you.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">bows in his chains</span> Can only try sir - but I got this annoying face like...</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">smirks at Quinn.</p>
  <p>Just the mouth.</p>
  <p class="action">sits a sighs... no its quiet he more softly asks Orin.</p>
  <p>You okay?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">looks over at Biron</span> Well, I can't always help meself none - he's like a kitten. So much fun to play with...</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">sits quietly in the corner, staring at the wall like its a window.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>If you need to poke poke... but  wont be helping once we're out there.. I don't want extra lashings.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">scratches at his crotch area</span> Anyway, we all agreed then? I'll just take the blame as I was kinda baitin' him some over the last few hours. Way I remember it, he kinda lurched at me to give me the hidin' I was asking for, and poor Orin here found themselves in the way like.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">speaks up again.</p>
  <p>No.</p>
  <p>You will not take my problem.</p>
  <p>Take theirs if you want.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">falls silent again.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sighs.</p>
  <p>Quinn it wasn't you... he didn't hear us <q>pretend</q> to let him free.</p>
  <p>He thought we'd actually lost him.</p>
  <p>Doesn't excuse it!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">shoots Biron a look.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">sniffs</span> Not trying to be a martyr none. But there ain't gonna be no lyin' to these boys - they know their stuff and no mistake. No, I'm gonna 'ave to take the blame - it was me calling him   and   that gave him the 'ump.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>They only care about the fight.</p>
  <p>They don't care what happened before.</p>
  <p>You can attempt it but with Biron shooting you down they're probably not gonna believe you.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>''yeah but sir, that fight was my mouth's fault - don't wan you fine folk hatin' on me cos you've swallowed my medicine like''</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I intend to plead not guilty as I said.</p>
  <p>We might end up taking it with more if you speak and Biron starts.</p>
  <p>Like I said I wont order anyone to do anything.. I wont be adding or helping.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sits in the corner again clearly a little bothered.</p>
  <p>They don't actually care.. they need someone to punish.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">struggles to scratch at his nose, his wrist constrained by the chains.</p>
  <p>Ya know, if you grow up in the gutters of Kastenburg, a target for every drunk and ne'er-do-well in the city, this 'ere prison room starts to look damn tidy like...</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>At that moment the party hear a rattling of chains: the grim veterans that guard Larke's mansion are collecting up the ne'er do wells of the camp for court-martialing.</p>

<p>They un-shackle the party from the walls and start leading them up through the winding passages and stairs.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">doffs his non-existent cap at the guard, smiling broadly.</dd>
</dl>

<p>You find yourselves in what was perhaps once a walled garden, now much overgrown. Vins sits under a tent, eating lunch from a spread of birds, fruits and porks before him, attended by a pair of squawking sycophants.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">eyes the food hungrily.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Behind him stands Walter, occasionally whispering into his ear.</p>

<p>Miserable looking mercenaries line up to have their cases heard. You have a whiles, but as you slowly trudge towards justice you hear a sharp whisper.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>Fine mess, this time! By the Father, what did you do this time?</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">bows his head a quietly whispers.</p>
  <p>I couldn't control Biron... He went off the wall.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">mutters</span> He didn't mean nuffin' by it.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">shoots a look at Agata, but only for a second and then they're looking at the ground again.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns to Ba.</p>
  <p>That's your job! This is the second such mess in merely a week!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I know. He nearly took my head off and then Orins.</p>
  <p class="action">whispers quieter so the others dont here.</p>
  <p>Besides putting him down I'm out of options.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns to Biron.</p>
  <p>I should let them flog you.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stares straight ahead.</p>
  <p>Yes ser.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">clears his throat</span> Beggin' ya pardon ser, but he ain't deservin' of that. He's a fightin' man - why he's so useful round these parts. Couldn't want a better man at me back like. And fighin' men, well they like to fight like. No-one got hurt none.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns to Quinn.</p>
  <p>Last I checked, Griffin Company is all stocked up on blood-thirsty goons.</p>
  <p>You're fetches, you're supposed to be, you know, subtle.</p>
  <p>Give me one good reason why I should put in a good word for you?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">says nothing.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>Personally ser... you shouldn't.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sighs and looks off into the distance again, his eyes unfocused.</p>
  <p>Old Quinn here never had much of a family. No father like to speak of. Not till I joined you fine folk like. Biron here has been like a father to me, putting me right when I step out of place, giving me a cuff when I...</p>
  <p class="action">He shuffles slightly at the elbow in his side.</p>
  <p>Yeah, well you take me meaning sir.</p>
</dd>

  <p>Mark rolled a 3 for Quinn Wheatsteal's Persuasion check.</p>

  <p>Ric says, <q>Ouchie.</q></p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>No I do not take your meaning, Private Quinn. This is a mercenary company, not a family-run farm.
  <p>Orin, do you have anything to say about all of this?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">shrugs.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>Very well, come see me after this... if they don't hang you.</dd>

<p>It has been observed by great philosophers that time always seems to be at its slowest when certain doom approaches. You've all felt that terrible wait on the battlefield before the call to arms. It seems an age before you are standing before severe, hawk-nosed Lieutenant Vins.</p>

<p>He hits you with a dead-eyed stare, unblinking, as Walter reads out the charges against you.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Vins</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Assaulting a senior officer is a serious offence. It's a flogging offence, and the same for anyone who might be involved.</p>
  <p>I understand two of you plead guilty?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">steps forward.</p>
  <p>They're not senior but I attacked Orin.</p>

  <p>Yes ser.</p>
  <p class="action">steps back.</p>

<dt>Vins</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">eyes harrow, his black eyes focussing like a hawk on Orin.</p>
  <p>What was that, private?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">doesn't look up from the floor.</p>
  <p>Me, ser.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Vins</dt>
<dd>Is it true, did Corporal Biron attack you?</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Yes, ser.</dd>

<dt>Vins</dt>
<dd>You have proof of this?</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I don't know ser.</p>
  <p class="action">thinks a moment.</p>
  <p>Well I think my arrow wound started bleeding again.</p>

<dt>Biron</dt>

  <p class="action">eyes Orin and Biron's hand.</p>
  <p>Show me this wound.</p>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">pulls up their shirt to reveal bloodied stitches on their side.</dd>

<dt>Vins</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">eyes pass over Orin's wound, blood seeping from the pulled stitches. He seems to see everything.</p>
  <p>If this is the case, why is Private Quinn also pleading guilty?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">shuffles forward a little and smiles, bowing as he does so.</p>
  <p>Well, see I think I got a little confused like sir. Cos I got a few pains too from the good commander here too. But I wouldn't say attack.</p>
  <p>None. No, reprimand like... thats its. I'm sure both meself and my good friend Orin here are grateful for being kept on the straight and narrow like. No attacking, just a bit of discipline like.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">glares at Quinn.</p>
  <p>Speak for yourself.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Vins</dt>
<dd><q>Confused?</q> You're no longer pleading guilty?</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">smiles nervously</span> Well, I'm guilty of needin' some of the good corporal's discipline, if ya take me meaning some. And fair play to him, sir. hes been kind enough to dish it out when its needed, and no mistake.</dd>

  <p>This all sounds like an unlikely blood story if you ask me. The law of the Company has it that officers should not be assaulted, and if we make exceptions we risk tipping the camp into anarchy. Officer, have these mercenaries flogged!</p>
  <p>In addition, you will be fined ten gold pieces for...</p>

<p>At that moment, a handful of slates fall from the roof of the manor house, crashing noisily behind Vins.</p>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>What?</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">steps forward slightly</span> Beggin' ya pardon sir, but am I right in thinking that it's only meself to be flogged. None of me friends here were so stupid to misunderstand the charge none, sir.</dd>

<dt>Vins</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">raises an eyebrow.</p>
  <p>Did I stutter?</p>

  <p>Shut Up! it will get worse.</p>

<dd>No ser!</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">goes to speak but thinks better of it.</dd>
</dl>

<p>With that they are unceremoniously dragged off. As they depart, one of Vins sycophantic sergeants starts gossiping. <q>I hear they're having a bumper harvest north of the border, while we eat scraps here...</q> Rget do not hear the rest as they are dragged out of the garden and taken outside, to the flogging square.</p>

<aside>
  <p>Ric says, <q>You are all <em>flogged</em>, gain a level of exhaustion. Also please deduct 10 gold pieces, you get to decide amongst you who pays?</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>Orin will contribute 2gp.</q></p>
  <p>Mark says, <q>I guess Quinn will contribute 5 (all his cash) as he is kinda to blame a bit LOL.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>He's genuinely not, you know.</q></p>
  <p>Liam says, <q>Biron will do 5 and refuses to take Orin's. He is genuinely not. At all LOL.</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>But it shows good loyalty that he's willing to take some blame.</q></p>

<p>The party find themselves back at the fetches' camp, standing around the camp fire near your tents. The mood is subdued, all are weary.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stretches as he cleans the wounds up.</p>
  <p>We need to go see Agata... get ready.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">drinks freely from their wineskin.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">shrugging his shoulders and wincing, he nods to Ba, then tilts his head to one side.</p>
  <p>An' everything's worked out with that other one?  Helia?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">grunts as he gets ready.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>We'll have to ask Agata.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>No clue.</p>
  <p>Exactly that.</p>
  <p>Seen as we couldnt be the ones to hand them over.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">shoots another look at Biron.</p>
  <p>We cant be certain.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">tries to put his fingers to his back and mutters</span> By the mother, think they've wrecked this shirt. A mighty shame that. Was my favourite. Found it a few years back...</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">goes to their tent and shrugs their pack over the shoulder with fewer welts. They try to find a comfortable way of slinging their bow around, but elect to hold it in their hand instead.</p>
  <p class="action">goes back out to the campfire and drinks while waiting for the rest to be ready.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">stands and waits for the group to be ready, his entire chest and stomach area wrapped and bandaged now.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">sits and waits in silence.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">approaches Orin with his scant belongings over one shoulder, occasionally trying to shift the weight and with a pained look on his face.</p>
  <p><span class="action">throws his pack down and sits on it</span> Never did thank ya none for saving me life back there... I don't forget stuff like that friend.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">doesn't respond, except to pass the wineskin to Quinn.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">winks and takes a gulp before handing it back.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">sighs</span> Well, the lieutenant seemed like a reasonable enough fella.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">rolls his eyes.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">looks around and sees everyone is there. Silently, they get up and walk to Agata's tent.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">stands, slings his pack over his shoulder and immediately regrets it and shuffles after Orin.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">heads off following Orin.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">marches through the mud towards Agata's tent.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">lets out a whistle</span> That's a pretty dandy bow ya got there. Elm right? A pretty dandy bow indeed.</dd>
</dl>

<p>You find your way to Agata's tent. Tall and fair Loth stands guard outside. He nods as you approach, and opens the tent for you to enter.</p>

<p>Within it is gloomy and smokey, lit by a couple of lanterns.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">smiles and nods</span> Much obliged like.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">enters trying to walk with as little wince as possible nodding at Loth.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Agata is pouring over her letters and papers, as always.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks up.</p>
  <p>I heard about the flogging, an ugly business.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">stands to attention, opens his mouth to speak, looks at Ba, then shuts his mouth.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">stares into the air between themself and Agata.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">notices the mouth movement from his left and just smiles.</p>
  <p>It is what it is, ser.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Vins is a bit too liberal with the floggings, if you ask me.</p>
  <p>But no one does on account of how I'm just  a sergeant.</p>
  <p>Lets keep our tempers in check, in future.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd class="action">nods to Biron.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">growls.. before nodding.</p>
  <p>Yes, ser.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>Very good. Now, tonight... what is the plan?</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>First ser, I wanted to ask.</p>
  <p>Did the handoff to Helia go well?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>It did. Helia left chasing traitors, and she seemed happy with the job lot we gave her.</p>
  <p>Hopefully, we've satisfied the king's bailiffs and their insatiable curiosity... for a while.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sighs a little relieved.</p>
  <p>Well thats one bit of good news.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">eyes Biron for a reaction.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">stoney face twitches but manages to remain relatively blank.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Indeed, well done on that.</p>
  <p>Of course, they wouldn't have been here in the first place if not for that mess in Dismas.</p>
  <p>But we're in the clear.</p>
  <p>For now.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>As to tonight... We only managed to obtained one card.</p>
  <p>The Five of Coins.</p>
  <p>Which unfortunately means only one of us can be sat in the game.</p>
  <p>My suggestion for that is Orin or Quinn.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">sighs</span> Always liked a card game. Won these trews in one a couple of years back and they've served me well enough. But the stakes 'ere may be a little high for old Quinn. Little worried I may drop us all in it. Never been good at the pretending lark, if ya takes my meaning some.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>I'm too noticeable but you don't seem a talker... and Biron... well.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>Indeed.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>If you're not feeling entirely on it Orin?</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>I can do it.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">scratches at his stubble</span> I mean I don't mind none - but I'll 'ave to take instructions from ya good selves. And if we go off script some, we could be in the hot brown, if ya pardon me expression ma'am.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>And what if its not real.</p>
  <p>We need someone there to confirm it before we go rounding people up.</p>
  <p>Too easy to play it off as we have no evidence.</p>
  <p>Once one of us has been given our <q>order</q> we can move.</p>
  <p>The rest of us can hide nearby, either as drunkards or just in a tent hiding.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">grins</span> Now, drunk, I can play.</p>
  <p>But in all seriousness, if Orin don't fancy it none, Quinn'l do it. But Orin may be the smarter choice and no mistake.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>Orin? you've been awfully quiet.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>I said I can do it.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Sorry didn't hear you. Good. In which case.., how does Quinn and Biron nearby drinking the night away and me covering from stealth.</p>
  <p>I might be able to even cover from a watch tower.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">shrugs.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks to Orin.</p>
  <p>I wouldn't mind a second pair of eye up in the tower?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">nods</span> Aye, their bow has come in sure handy before now, and no mistake. Old Quinn's still got his skin for sure. Well, the bits that ain't flayed none at least.</p>
  <p><span class="action">looks to Ba</span> I can join ya with my bow. I'm no shot like Orin here, but I can pull a string if ya take my meaning.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>I don't care either way.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I'd rather have Orin away from Biron for now.</p>
  <p class="action">eyes flick to them both.</p>
  <p>No offence.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">shrugs.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">frowns at Orin</span> You alright there friend? If it's killing that guy, don't be sad none. Ya saved my life and one of us, me or him, was gonna die.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Very well, it sounds like you have a plan. I suggest you all rest-up before midnight.</p>
  <p>You all look like shite!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">ignores Quinn.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">pulls a mock offended look.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>If there is nothing else?</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">starts to leave the tent before stopping and awkwardly turning to Agata.</p>
  <p>No, ser.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">shuffles nervously</span> Well, I don't s'pose ya got any wine - for pouring on the wounds like. Takes the sting out like...</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd class="action">raises an eyebrow.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns and kicks Quinn in the shin.</p>
  <p>Shut up.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>Do I look like a tavern keeper, Private Quinn?</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">smiles</span> No, thought not ser.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>Very good, dismissed!</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">leaves without another word.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">nods.</p>
  <p>Much obliged.</p>
  <p><span class="action">walks quickly to catch up with Orin</span> Hey, what's the problem friend. 'ave I offended you some?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">leaves and heads straight to rest.</p>
  <p>Meet at the fetch camp fire an hour before.</p>
  <p class="action">leaves.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">also leaves, but in the direction of the traders' stalls.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">nods and casts a worried look at Ba</span> Aye ser.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">stomps off in the direction of his tent.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">stands alone, deserted in all directions for a few moments. Then shrugs and whistling to himself heads towards his tent.</dd>
</dl>

<p>It is late when you head to your tents, and you all manage a few hours rest. You sleep fitfully on your sores, and awaken feeling less tired, but still very exhausted.</p>

<p>You start out on the night's grim business with a dark cloud hanging over your heads, despite the clear night sky that evening.</p>

<p>To be continued...</p>
