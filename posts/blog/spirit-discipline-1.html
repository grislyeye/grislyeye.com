<p>
  Due to the unpleasant situation surrounding
  <span class="title">Wizards of the Coast</span> and the
  <a
    href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jan/12/dungeons-and-dragons-wizards-of-the-coast-ogl"
    >OGL 1.1</a
  >, I’m (like many others) moving away from
  <span class="product">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span> and 5E. I wasn’t
  completely unprepared for this eventuality, and I’ve been researching
  alternative systems.
</p>

<p>
  One that does tick all my boxes (low powered, skill-based, well-supported,
  etc.) is <span class="product">Forbidden Lands</span>, which uses the
  <span class="product">Year Zero Engine</span>. It’s also open content. The
  underlying system is published under OGL unfortunately,
  <strong>but</strong> Free League are planning to change this in the near
  future.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, I can’t help tinkering. One of my players is running a sorcerer
  with some specific spells they’d like to transfer over to
  <span class="product">Forbidden Lands</span>. So, I’ve quickly hacked the
  following new magic discipline. Because I’m a good GM.
</p>

<p>
  Now, this is just a very rough first draft, so please don’t judge and do give
  me some ideas on how to improve it…

<h2 id="spirit-discipline">Spirit Discipline</h2>

<p class="preview">
  Spirit magic deals with worlds unseen. Planes that exist alongside the mortal
  world, yet separate. A spirit worker acts as an intermediary with the strange
  beings that live there: the spirits. Many druids and sorcerers practice this
  discipline, but all have relationships with different types of spirits. A
  druid might commune with spirits of nature, a sorcerer might speak with the
  fey or the <em>things</em> that live in the shadows.

    <p>
      You summon unseen spirits that whisper horrific secrets in the ears of
      your enemies. The spell inflicts damage to Wits equal to the Power Level.
      You can spread this damage across a number of targets, making a spell
      attack for each. Armour does not protect against this spell.

    <p>
      You cover yourself in the mien of a spirit you are familiar, perhaps a
      spirit encountered during a Spirit Walk (see below). You might appear as a
      dead person, a dark figure or an animal. Your size, attributes and
      abilities cannot change.

    <p>
      You summon minor spirit, an insubstantial being from another plane. It
      always obeys your commands and can be used to stealthily observe and
      report back to you. It vanishes after the spell ends, or when you dismiss
      it.

      <dt>INGREDIENT:</dt>
      <dd>Hallucinogenic substance</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      You enter a trance-like state, and find your disembodied spirit wandering
      through the liminal paths of the spirit world, leaving your physical form
      behind. Here you can see and speak to spirits. With a successful
      MANIPULATION check, you might learn something of value, such as secrets
      only the dead might know, or the true name of a fairy.

    <p>
      You cut through the veil between worlds, revealing a horrifying glimpse of
      what lies beyond the mortal realm. The spell inflicts damage to Wits equal
      to the Power Level, to all creature in range.

    <p>
      Time and distance do not work by the same laws as the mortal world. With
      this spell, you can create a passage to another NEAR location, taking a
      shortcut through the spirit world. For each Power Level above 1, you can
      take one additional CLOSE human-sized creature along with you. You can
      also spend a Power Level to open a door a SHORT distance away.

    <p>
      You summon a demon-like being from the spirit world. Choose the stats of
      an animal from the table on page 126 in the <em>Gamemaster’s Guide</em> to
      represent this spirit. You cannot choose an animal with a Strength higher
      than twice the Power Level. Also, the spirit possesses a random demon
      ability from the random table on page 82 in the
      <em>Gamemaster’s Guide</em>. The spirit always obeys your commands, until
      it is dismissed or the spell ends.
