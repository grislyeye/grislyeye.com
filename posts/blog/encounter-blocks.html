<p class="preview">
  Encounter blocks are an attempt to compress information about <em>how</em> to
  run encounters into a digestible format. This a preview of a as-yet untitled
  book on non-player characters
  <a href="/blog/npc-block-v4.html">I'm working on</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Here is an example of an encounter block for that common, low-level encounter,
  the wandering predators:
</p>

  alt="Example encounter block block for wandering predators"
/>

<h4>Header</h4>

<p>
  As with the monster stat block, the header contains the name and a brief
  summary of the encounter:
</p>

<img
  class="medium"
  src="/images/encounter-blocks/example-header.png"
  alt="Example encounter block header"
/>

<p>
  I've used the <q>level and threat</q> trap notation from
  <span class="product">Xanathar's Guide to Everything</span> to describe rough
  tiers of difficulty. I intend encounters to be random with a range of possible
  challenge ratings. Hence the vaguer categorisation.
</p>

<p>
  This needs some work to map the encounter difficulties from the DMG to
  encounter levels and threats. It might even make a better alternative to (much
  maligned) CR.
</p>

<p>
  Attitude is a reference to the social interaction rules from chapter 8 of the
  <span class="product">Dungeon Master's Guide</span>. I use these rules a lot
  in my own campaigns. Attitude also gives an important cue for how the
  encounter will respond to the party. Hostile encounters will generally be
  combat encounters. Isndifferent/friendly encounters would be some kind of
  non-combat challenge or roleplaying opportunity.
</p>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>
  After the header follows a description of what monsters/NPCs make-up the
  encounter. This is usually rolled for. For example:
</p>

<img
  class="medium"
  src="/images/encounter-blocks/example-description.png"
  alt="Example encounter block description"
/>

<p>
  This has a nice side-effect of grouping monsters and non-player characters
  under similar themes. Sometimes it not always obvious which monsters work well
  together.
</p>

<h4>Tactics</h4>

<p>
  Next is the <q>Tactic</q> section, which describes how to run the encounter:
</p>

<img
  class="medium"
  src="/images/encounter-blocks/example-tactics.png"
  alt="Example encounter block tactics"
/>

<p>
  This is the core of the encounter block: the
  <span class="product">Monster Manual</span> doesn't always make it clear
  <em>how</em> to actually run monsters. The tactics section makes this explicit
  in an easy to consume format. A DM can look through the sub-headings here and
  quickly have a clear idea of how the encounter will react to the party and
  what it might do in combat.
</p>

  <strong>Hat tip:</strong> Borrowed from
  <a
    href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGcreation/comments/gxucmu/behavior_an_addition_to_monster_stat_blocks/"
    >u/kinseki</a
  >
  on r/RPGcreation.
</p>

<h4>Habits</h4>

<p>Last is the <q>Habits</q> section:</p>

<img
  class="medium"
  src="/images/encounter-blocks/example-habits.png"
  alt="Example encounter block habits"
/>

<p>
  Habits are the everyday things a group of monsters and NPCs might be doing
  when encountered. They serves two purposes: first, to help set the scene for
  the encounter. Is the wandering predator lying in wait to pounce, or looking
  after it's young when the PCs happen upon it?
</p>

<p>
  It also helps with verisimilitude, encouraging a sense that the world is
  moving even when the party are not there. DMs can give the sense the party
  have stumbled onto the monster <em>in media res</em>. The encounter isn't
  waiting around for the party arrive like a computer game NPC.
</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>
  I hope you found this useful, please feel free to steal any and all of the
  ideas here. All I ask is you let me know how you used them, and what did and
  did not work.
