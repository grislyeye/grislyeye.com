<p class="preview">Here is a (brief) list of languages for my homebrew setting. As is my wont, I eschew common fantasy languages like Elvish. Instead, the following languages are spoken and written in the Low Kingdoms...</p>

<aside>
  <h5>The Low Kingdoms</h5>

  <p>I've been tinkering with my homebrew setting, the Low Kingdoms, for a few years now. Mostly through play.</p>

  <p>This post is part of the process of tidying it up for publication.</p>
</aside>

<p><strong>Half-Tongue.</strong> The pidgin language of the fey. It's a dialect of Common and the First Speech that changes with every speaking. No two sentences are alike, even if they have the same meaning.</p>

<p><strong>Old Common.</strong> The florid language of the Old Empire. Mainly used by scholars.</p>

<p><strong>Malifigua.</strong> This despicable tongue is said to be taught by demons to their infernal followers. For those who cannot understand, it is nauseating to hear.</p>

<p><strong>Norf.</strong> The vulgar language of T'ill North.</p>

<p><strong>Sermon Form.</strong> A coded dialect used by ecclesiastical scholars. It has been largely forgotten, except to conceal heretical works. Written only.</p>

<p><strong>Solemn.</strong> The whispered language spoken amongst the dead. Non-speakers can't even hear this tongue, which sounds like indistinct mumblings to them.</p>
