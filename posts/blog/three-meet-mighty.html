  <p>This article is part of a series following the design of my low-fantasy 5E hack, <a href="https://grislyeye.github.io/three-meet/">Three Meet</a>. The game is free, and you can read the draft now. If you have any feedback, please post on the <a href="https://github.com/grislyeye/three-meet/discussions">forum</a>.</p>

<p class="preview">Ah, to be strong of limb, firm of body. To be wrapped in a thick armour of vascular flesh. To slash, hammer, or stab all before you. To be mighty. <em>To be a fighter!</em></p>

<p>This article elaborates on the design for my generalised fighter class for <a href="https://grislyeye.github.io/three-meet/">Three Meet</a>, The Mighty. Three Meet is a low-powered fantasy game, so I wanted to make lower-levels more interesting. And give all players interesting subclass choices at 1st level.</p>

<p>For The Mighty, I used the 5E fighter class as a base, and looked for some obvious seams there. The objective was to re-work the fighter into a more general class, and create at least one subclass.</p>

<h4>Subclass: Defender</h4>

<p>I offered my players several prototypes subclasses, including the Brawler (specialising in unarmed combat), and the Berserker (a barbarian-like subclass). In the end, they went with the Defender, which specialises in protecting allies.</p>

<h5>Fighting Style</h5>

<p>An easy win is to cleave off the 1st level fighting styles. Trivially, each style could work as the basis for a new subclass. Dueling for a Dueller subclass, etc. In this case, I will be using Protection for the Defender.</p>

<h5>Second Wind</h5>

<p>Second Wind is a short rest feature that allows you to regain 1d10 hit points (plus your level). That’s roughly about 6 hit points, at 1st level. It’s pretty useful and powerful on its own, but I wanted more choice here.</p>

<p>My first real design is to have a Second Wind-like option for all the Mighty subclasses. Similar to the cleric’s channel divinity feature, that allows you to swap in other abilities.</p>

<p>I’m calling these <q>Surges</q>.</p>

<p>The Defender archetype gives you the Block surge: you can use your <strong>Reaction</strong> to reduce the damage from an attack that targets an ally by 1d10.</p>

<p>I'm not sure this <q>Surge</q> design will work for all potential archetypes. For the prototype Berserker subclass, I created a Rage Surge, based off the barbarian's Rage feature. I'm still unsure this worked: barbarian rage gives a lot of bonuses, including a hefty resistance to all non-magical weapon damage. I'm uncertain if this balances with second wind.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>So far, my players seem to be enjoying the Defender. The appeal is the ability to intercept attacks against weaker allies. This has lots of interesting flavour potential. The block surge is yet to be used in anger, though. My instinct is that it will feel powerful for a Defender, but might be too similar to the Protection fighting style. The true test will be whether my players will use it more often than the second wind surge.</p>
