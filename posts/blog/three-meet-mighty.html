  Ah, to be strong of limb, firm of body. To be wrapped in a thick armour of
  vascular flesh. To slash, hammer, or stab all before you. To be mighty.
  <em>To be a fighter!</em>
</p>

<p>
  This article elaborates on the design for my generalised fighter class for
  <a href="https://grislyeye.github.io/three-meet/">Three Meet</a>,
  <q>The Mighty</q>. I'm designing Three Meet as a low-powered 5E hack, and
  wanted to make lower-levels more interesting. In this case, by giving all
  players interesting subclass choices at 1st level.
</p>

<h4>Subclass: Defender</h4>

<p>
  For The Mighty, I'm using the 5E fighter class as a base, and looking for some
  obvious seams there. The objective is to re-work the fighter into a more
  generalised class, and create at least one subclass.
</p>

<p>
  I offered my players several prototypes subclasses, including the Brawler
  (specialising in unarmed combat), and the Berserker (a barbarian-like
  subclass). In the end, they went with the Defender which specialises in
  protecting allies.

<h5>Fighting Style</h5>

<p>
  An easy win is to cleave off the 1st level fighting styles. Trivially, each
  style could work as the basis for a new subclass. Dueling for a Dueller
  subclass, etc. In this case, I will be using the Protection fighting style for
  the Defender.
</p>

<h5>Second Wind</h5>

<p>
  Second Wind is a 1st-level Fight, short-rest feature that allows you to regain
  1d10 hit points (plus your level). It’s pretty useful and powerful on its own,
  but I wanted more choice here.
</p>

<p>
  My first real design is to have a Second Wind-like option for all the Mighty
  subclasses. Similar to the cleric’s Channel Divinity feature, that gives you a
  spell-like slot that you can spend on other abilities.
</p>

<p>I’m calling this feature <q>Surge</q>, and these abilities <q>Surges</q>.</p>

<p>
  The Defender subclass gives you the Block surge: you can use your Reaction to
  reduce the damage from an attack that targets an ally by 1d10 Damage.
</p>

<p>
  I'm not sure this <q>Surge</q> design will work for all potential subclasses.
  For the prototype Berserker subclass, I created a Rage Surge, based off the
  barbarian's Rage feature. I'm uncertain this balances with Second Wind:
  barbarian rage gives a lot of bonuses, including a hefty resistance to all
  non-magical, weapon damage.
</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>
  So far, my players seem to be enjoying the Defender. The appeal is the ability
  to intercept attacks against weaker allies. This has lots of interesting
  flavour potential. The block surge is yet to be used in anger, though. My
  instinct is that it will feel powerful for a Defender, but might be too
  similar to the Protection fighting style. The true test will be whether my
  players will use it more often than the second wind surge.
