<p>
  The Magic Guild is a fraternity of wizards formed to protect the secrets of
  magic. In exchange for training and access to guild libraries, members are
  expected to abide by the complex bylaws of the guild.
</p>

<p>
  <strong><em>The Royal Charter.</em></strong> In ages past, there arose a great
  scourge of evil sorcerers, necromancers and witches. To contain this threat,
  the old kings and queens planned to outlaw the practice of magic outright. A
  council of powerful wizards convened to convince the nobility otherwise. The
  nobles conceded on one condition: that the council itself become the guardians
  of magic, keeping its secrets, protecting the innocent and punishing those who
  would use it for evil ends.
</p>

<p>
  From that council the Magic Guild was formed. To this day, guild magicians can
  be recognised by a folded copy of that first, royal charter, prominently wax
  sealed to their robes.
</p>

<p>
  <strong><em>Dark Magic.</em></strong> Of all the guild laws, the prohibition
  against curses, maledictions and hexes is it's most important. Guild members
  are forbidden from casting any spell that harms an innocent. Furthermore, they
  are duty-bound to capture or kill spellcasters who use magic for evil.
</p>

<p>
  Over the years the definition of what counts as forbidden magic has...
  shifted. Zealous guild masters have taken broader definitions. Sometimes
  merely to consolidate the guild's monopoly on "true" magic. Innocent sorcerers
  and warlocks are easily swept up in these purges.
</p>

<p>
  <strong><em>The Libraries.</em></strong> The guild's greatest treasures are
  it's well-stocked libraries. Each guild chapter house has its own library,
  containing a comprehensive collection of wizard spells. These spellbooks are
  kept in vaults, protected by mystic puzzles, deadly traps and magical locks.
  Furthermore, libraries are partitioned into three "circles" depending on the
  power of the spells contained: the first, second and third circles. Higher
  circles are restricted to high-ranking guild members only.
</p>

<p>
  <strong><em>Requirements.</em></strong> Guild magicians make great pains to
  distinguish their <q>high</q> magic from the unlearned <q>hedge</q> magic of
  warlocks or sorcerers. For this reason, only wizards may join the Magic Guild.
  Even then certain schools are forbidden, notably the School of Necromancy.
</p>

<h4>Goals and Ideals</h4>

<p>
  <strong><em>Law of the Arcane.</em></strong> Do not reveal the secrets of
  magic to non-guild members (Lawful)
</p>

<p>
  <strong><em>Law of Responsibility.</em></strong> Using magic for evil ends is
  forbidden (Good)
</p>

<h4>Missions</h4>

<p>Typical guild missions include:</p>

<p>
  <strong><em>Collect Arcane Lore.</em></strong> The guild hoards magic, lest
  the arcane secrets reach undeserving hands. Guild magicians are rewarded for
  "returning" scrolls, spellbooks and magic items to their guildhalls.
</p>

<p>
  <strong><em>Sanction Evil Magic.</em></strong> Guild magicians are frequently
  mandated to hunt down and capture or kill spellcasters guilty of casting evil
  magic or trafficking with malevolent spirits.

        <strong>Arcane Library.</strong> While back at your guild quarters, you
        gain access to the "common" areas of the guild libraries. This allows
        you to enquire about or research arcane matters, which you might or
        might not find an answer for. The DM may offer advantage on Intelligence
        (Arcana) checks, or reduce the time or cost for arcane downtime
        activities, such as crafting a magical item, at their discretion.
