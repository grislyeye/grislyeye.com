<p>In the <em>11th</em> instalment of <span class="product">Black Griffin</span> in which the party partakes of a double-cross and buys themselves some time...</p>

<p>This campaign diary taken from the <q>in-character</q> chat channel from session 40 of my ongoing playtest campaign, lightly polished and annotated.</p>

<p>Black Griffin is a play-by-chat game that runs every week on Roll20. The party are mercenaries in the employ of the infamous Company of the Black Griffin. Lowly even for sellswords, they have been placed on punishment duty as company <q>fetches</q>: bounty hunters charged with capture of deserters for trial.</p>

<h5>Scene IX: The Hand Over</h5>

<p>When we last left our collection of curmudgeonly crooks, they had learned of a meeting of spies and turncoats: a mysterious game of cards played at midnight.</p>

<p>There was a high toll to learn this information, and we join Biron as he emerges from the foul cellars-turned-oubliette of Captain Larke's manor house.</p>

<p>After the gloom of the cellars, it seems incredible that it is daylight outside, and Biron blinks in the sunlight.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">storms out, striding forward with his axe in hand.</p>
  <p class="action">roars loudly, picking up some old wooden barrel and hurling it as far as he could with a roar of ridiculous anger. He seems oblivious to anyone around him.</p>
  <p class="action">stays silent a moment and looks back at the house.</p>
  <p>They should die!</p>
  <p>Traitorous, honor-less slugs.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Ric says, <q>ðŸ”¥ Inspiration for Biron for a great scene!</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>While Biron is ranting what are Orin, Ba and Quinn up to? Will they join the others?</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>The agreement I had with Ba is that we were to release Eggard while he talked to Helia.</q></p>
  <p>Liam says, <q>I will be quickly passing to go and inform Helia.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>After releasing Eggard, Orin is going to try getting Lucas' card while they wait for Helia.</q></p>
  <p>Mark says, <q>Yeah, I guess Quinn will be walking with Orin.</q></p>
  <p class="break"></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Make a Persuasion check for Orin please, DC 18.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan rolled a 10 for Orin's Persuasion check.</p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>Orin's going to try taking Eggard out a different entrance than the one they came in by, to try to avoid Biron.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>Orin is keeping their eyes' peeled.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan rolled a 23 for Orin's Perception check.</p>

<dd>If anyone'll be burning traitors, it'll be I.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">glances up at this comment. a little bit surprised but no less angry.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Biron is surprised by the sound Helia's voice, and turns around to see the stern northerner accompanied by her surly bailiffs and Ba'Raknul, here to collect her dues.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Quinn and Orin emerge from the scullery door of Larke's manor house, dragging Eggard between them.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Eggard</dt>
<dd>Where are you taking me?</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>We don't break our promises, Eggard.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">scratches at a spot on his chin</span> Takin' ya somwhere where ya can take ya self I be thinkin'. But that would be up to my friend here, o'course.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">holds Eggard's pack tightly in their opposite hand.</dd>

<dt>Eggard</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks from Quinn to Orin, searching for the lie in their faces.</p>
  <p>You're joking?</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>You're actually going to let me go?</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">looks for anyone dangerous to their plan in the area.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>''No, joke none. Folk of honour us. That's what ya was promised. In fact, we aint none to turn ya out without the means of survival...'</dd>

<dt>Eggard</dt>
<dd>Means of... survival?</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">subtly winks to Orin then turns back to Eggard.</p>
  <p>Here, take some coin - so ya can buy some food when you find an outpost or village.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">reappraises Quinn after seeing this generousity.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Orin furiously scans the crowds of milling company men and women... so far seems all clear.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">holds Eggard tight and moves for the nearest gate.</dd>

<dt>Eggard</dt>
<dd class="action">eagerly takes the coins, tears forming in his eyes at the generosity.</dd>
</dl>

<p>He seems completely speechless.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Let's go.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">nods and pushes Eggard gently forward.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">whispers:</p>
  <p>Slowly.</p>
  <p>We're being followed.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">stops and bends to adjust his boots, subtly looks behind him as he does so.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Quinn spots a man, head completely hairless, sporting several elaborate piercings, rings and chains about his ears, trying to appear nonchalant.</p>

<p>He is clearly following Quinn and Orin though.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">still whispering:</p>
  <p>Can we lose him in the tents?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stands and continues to walk, whispering in reply.</p>
  <p>Could try, or do you want me to block his path, delay him some while you take our friend here beyond the perimeter some?</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Quinn and Orin find themselves at the row of tents housing traders, catamites, and purveyors of dubious foods, that leads to the South Gate exit to the camp.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Here. Let's duck into a trader's tend and slip under the back wall.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">nods</span> Aye, if not, I may be able to cause a distraction like...</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>That could work.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">whisper</span> Yeah... you go on some... I'll try to hold him up.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">leads Eggard to the trader's tent.</p>
  <p>Eggard. No funny business. We may have set you free, but that just makes you a traitor to them. You want to get home in one piece, don't you?</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Make a Stealth check for Orin please, and the pair of you roll initiative please.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan rolled a 24 for Orin's Stealth check.</p>
  <p>Morgan rolled a 6 for Orin's Initiative check.</p>
  <p>Mark rolled a 14 for Quinn's Initiative check.</p>
  <p>Liam says, <q>Weâ€™re about to see what Quinn can do!</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>I think we should have surprise... ðŸ˜›</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Hmmm, he was ready for something so no surprise, but you are hidden so get advantage on your attack.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>'For the Folk!' is a Commonwealth cry!</q></p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Eggard</dt>
<dd class="action">nods mutely.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">pretends to be looking at an item near the front of the tent.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">clears his throat, adjusts his trews slightly and heads with feigned confidence back the way they came towards the bald stranger.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">as he approaches he grins and nods slightly at the man</span> 'Scuse me guv'ner - don't s'pose ya could change some coin could ya?</p>
  <p class="action">fumbles around in his purse.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Mercenary</dt>
<dd class="action">licks his lips, pauses a moment, then goes for his sword.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">seeing Quinn has engaged the stranger, they duck out of the tent and run into the tents on the way to the South Gate.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Quinn gets the draw on the pierced mercenary.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Mercenary</dt>
<dd>FOR THE FOLK!</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">stops up short of the man, seeing him reach for his sword and quickly pulls his bow.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">mutters</span> Ye ain't coming closer guv'nor.</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Mark rolled a 26 for Quinn's Longbow attack using his menacing attack maneuver, dealing 14 piercing damage.</p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Do you want to do anything else on Quinn's turn?</q></p>
  <p>Mark says, <q>Just move back 30 feet.</q></p>
</aside>

<p>Quinn's arrow strikes the pierced mercenary in the left shoulder, knocking him back slightly. Unfortunately, he seems un-fazed by the attack and proceeds to draw his sword and approach.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">backs off 30 foot.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Clearly the man is right-handed, unfortunately.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>This way, Eggard. Use the tents for cover.</p>
  <p class="action">ducks into the tents out of the man's line of sight.</p>
  <p class="action">guides Eggard further toward the South Gate as swift as they can.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>With Eggard in tow, Orin weaves between the camp follower tents and makes it to the end of the row. The gate is just 30 feet away.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the pierced mercenary dives behind the wagon of the apple trader, pulls out a rather large and lethal looking crowsbow and aims it at Quinn.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">screams</span> I didn't mean nuffin' by it!</dd>
</dl>

<p>A bolt shoots and lands at Quinn's feet, burying itself in the hard soil up to the feathers. Quinn pauses momentarily to wonder what it would've done if it had hit his body!</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">curses and returns fire.</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Mark rolled a 15 for Quinn Wheatsteal's Longbow attack.</p>
</aside>

<dl></dl>

<p>Quinn's longbow shoots true, but hits the wood of the cart the mercenary is hiding behind. He gets a face full of wood splinters, but is otherwise unharmed.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">moves back to crouch behind a wagon, peering round and readying himself for the mercaneries next move.</p>
  <p>(back another 30ft if there's space - so around 65ft away or so)</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stands up tall.</p>
  <p>Act normal.</p>
  <p class="action">walks to the gate and out to the left behind the wall.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Morgan rolled a 15 for Orin's Deception check.</p>
</aside>

<dl></dl>

<p>The pierced mercenary is too preoccupied to notice Orin as they causally saunter to the gate. They find themselves standing outside the camp, the blasted waste of the Front spread out before them.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>This is it, Eggard.</p>
  <p>I have to go help my friend.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Eggard</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">seems to pause a moment, looking back into the camp with what seems to be longing... almost as though he was being dragged back by... something.</p>
  <p class="action">turns to Orin.</p>
  <p>Come with me! Fuck the Three Kings, and fuck this war!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Believe me, I'm thinking about it. But I'm not ready for that yet. I don't know how to live on the lamb. You've got that writ, but not me.</dd>

<dt>Eggard</dt>
<dd class="action">nods, and then runs off.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Run!</dd>

<dt>Eggard</dt>
<dd>They'll win, you know!</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">shrugs.</dd>
</dl>

<p>And with that he's gone.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">grins slyly before turning and running back to Quinn.</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Morgan rolled a 12 for Orin's Stealth check.</p>
</aside>

<dl></dl>

<p>Meanwhile, camp followers are scattering and screaming as they notice the bolts and arrows flying about their heads.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">shouts</span> Don't mind us, none!</dd>

<dt>Mercenary</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">moves closer, darting between running camp followers and ducks behind a pile of crates closer to Quinn's position.</p>
  <p>From his hiding place he fires another bolt at Quinn's head.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Quinn is too well covered, and the bolt harmlessly shatters the wheel of the wagon he's hiding behind.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">draws and looses another hopeful arrow.</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Mark rolled a 25 for Quinn Wheatsteal's Longbow attack, dealing 12 piercing damage.</p>
</aside>

<p>The arrow strikes the pierced traitor in the right shoulder this time, sending him spinning.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Mercenary</dt>
<dd>Shit, shit!</dd>
</dl>

<p>He's clearly very afeared of Quinn's fine aim.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">crouches back behind the wagon.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">slides between tents, positioning themself so that the commonwealth spy is clear in their view.</p>
  <p class="action">jumps out, arrow knocked and shoots, shouting...</p>
  <p>COMMONWEALTH TRAITOR!</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Morgan rolled a 16 for Orin's Shortbow attack, dealing 11 piercing damage.</p>
</aside>

<p>Quinn's arrow strikes true, hitting the traitor in the side of his face, sending shattered pieces of gold chains and rings of his piercings flying, as well as his jaw.</p>

<p>He slumps to the ground, dead.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">breathes heavily.</p>
  <p>Thank the father.</p>
  <p>Quinn help me drag him back to the manor.</p>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">staggers to his feet and runs his hand under his running nose</span> Aye aye, will do...</p>
  <p class="action">mutters.</p>
  <p>Best pick up these jewels and stuff first though right? Don't want 'em getting lost none.</p>
  <p class="action">scrabbles about the floor picking up the chains and rings.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">shrugs.</p>
  <p>Why not. See if he's got anything problematic on him while you're looking.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">looks up as he does so</span> Hates to say it, but I reckons it best this be split among the men - let em know some that theres wealth in loyalty - if ya takes my meaning some.</p>
  <p><span class="action">nods</span> Aye, will do.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>I don't give a damn about loyalty or gold. Do what you like.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">shrugs</span> ... ain't like no-one will be squealing about this as we speak anyway I figure.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Quinn collects what looks like about two gold pieces worth of shattered gold rings and chain piercings.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">stuffs em in one grubby pocket and goes and takes the man's legs.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">grabs the shoulders and leads them toward the manor.</dd>
</dl>

<p>It is not an unusual sight to see dead bodies being carried through the camp, so the pair of fetches barely get a second glance before they arrive at Larke's House just a second after Helia and Ba'Raknul show up.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns to Quinn and Orin.</p>
  <p>Corporal Ba'Raknul, what is this?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">looks at the two and to the man.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">mutters closing his eyes momentarilly</span> Mother watch over you, let your spirit depart your sins with your flesh.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>These are the two who were escorting Corporal Eggard.</p>
  <p>I dont know who he is.... Orin who is he?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">growls in the background.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>You mean chasing Corporal Eggard, Ba? Off the traitor's tip he'd be escaping?</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">glaring at Ba, Orin and Quinn.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>This one got in our way and stopped us from catching him.</dd>

<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">shrugs.</p>
  <p>Eggard won't get far.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks in shock to play along.</p>
  <p>He escaped? which way did he go.. and where did this one come from.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">opens his eyes, sees Biron and winks.</p>
  <p>Don't fret ye none - we're fine.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd class="action">nods to two of her large, adult bailiffs who run off towards the South Gate.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">looks at Quinn like he is about ready to plant his axe deep into him.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Pardon us, Sergeant. We're all very shocked by catching these traitors. And four, now. Not just three!</dd>

<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd class="action">looks between the four of you, warily, pushing her weight from one crutch to t'other.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">growls.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">shakes one leg of the corpse</span> This one stopped us giving chase, so he did - then drew his blade on me! Was only my friend Orin saving me skin or it would be old Quinn being carried about stiff like. If ye take me meaning some.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Those two downstairs, the puffy-eyed one confessed to your business in Dismas. Said the third was stealing away in the night.</p>
  <p>Quinn and I... we almost caught him!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">raises a hand to stay you.</p>
  <p>I don't know what's really going on, and to be honest, I don't care. As long as I get some traitors.</p>
  <p>Bring 'em out.</p>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Of course. Biron, would you help me?</dd>
