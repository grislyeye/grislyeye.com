<p class="preview">
  The Assayer's Guild is a preview of a faction from
  <span class="product">The Compendium of Factions</span> (working title, yet to
  be released). I developed the Assayers as part of a
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXWPWAZnQcc">recent live stream</a>
  and this is a first draft...
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Design Notes:</strong> The Assayer's Guild started as the Merchant's
  Guild, but I thought this was too generic. During the live stream we hit upon
  the name, <q>The Merchant's Consortium</q>. However, <q>consortium</q> is
  actually a (relatively) modern, 19th century term. Instead, I modelled the
  Assayers on trade guilds focussed on the working of precious metals, which
  hale from the 14th century.

  <h3>Assayer's Guild</h3>
  <p><em>Guild faction</em></p>
</header>

<p>
  Once a humble trade guild, the Worshipful Assayer's Guild is now a powerful
  company of traders, bankers and private landowners who have come together to
  further their own interests. Arrayed against them are nobles, priests and
  guilds, hostile to their growing influence.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>The Lore of Coins.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The Assayers first came to prominence as a trade guild, dealing in the
      working of precious metals. But it was the working of trade that made
      their fortune. Feuding nobles increasingly needed taxes to fund their
      wars. In order to fill their coffers they encouraged trade and so the
      merchant class was born.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is during this period the Assayers first came to influence, holding the
      trade secrets to mint the coins so vital to commerce. Yet, the Assayers
      discovered there was a seemingly magical trick to the coins. They offered
      a means of simplifying exchanges, but if you traded in the coins
      themselves their value could mysteriously grow. And so the power of
      Assayer's Guild grew...
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>The Silver and Gold Threads.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Unlike the nobility, the Assayers are not constrained to local geography.
      A growing network of trade routes links otherwise disparate nations
      together. And it is through these delicate threads of silver and gold that
      the Assayers exert their power. And nobles who earn the displeasure of the
      Assayers can find these threads cut off...
    </p>

    <p>
      It is not just the high born who increasingly find themselves under the
      thumb. Nearly every town, city and trade post has a guild chapter house
      where loans are offered and goods can be warehoused. For a price. Traders
      not vested by the Guild often find themselves receiving unfavourable
      terms, tariffs and prices.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Friends in High Places.</dt>
  <dd>
    The Assayer's Guild keeps its friends and its enemies closer. A large
    portion of its funds are spent buying the favour of high-ranking officials
    and nobles. The Assayers pay off gambling debts, fund lavish lifestyles, or
    offer extravagant bribes to win friends and get what they want. Cross the
    guild, and these powerful contacts will array their vast resources against
    you.
  </dd>

  <dt>The Spice.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Many ask, how are the Assayers allowed to keep their influence? They have
      no armies, no fanatical followers. What prevents the nobles from simply
      rounding up the leaders and executing them on the spot?
    </p>

    <p>
      The answer is whispered by those in the know: the mysterious <q>spice</q>.
      No one knows what the spice is, but they do know it is forbidden.
      Regardless, the trade in spice continues. No good is as valued or in more
      demand. And only the Assayer's Guild can supply it.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Assayer's Scales.</dt>
  <dd>
    Traders, merchants and bankers vested by the Assayer's Guild are known by
    the set of scales they carry, often prominently. To earn their scales,
    potentials members must first prove their worth and then tithe 10% of all
    their incomes to the guild.
