<p>This is the <em>sixth</em> campaign diary for my 5th Edition D&amp;D playtest campaign, <strong>Black Griffin</strong>. Black Griffin is a play-by-chat game that runs every week on Roll20. The party are mercenaries in the employ of the infamous Company of the Black Griffin. Lowly even for sellswords, they have been placed on punishment duty as company <q>fetches</q>: bounty hunters charged with capture of deserters for trial.</p>

<p>The below is an edited log from of our <q>in-character</q> chat channel. We've added annotations so you can follow what's going on. Please enjoy!</p>

<h5>Scene V: Debrief 1</h5>

<p>When we last saw our (mis)adventurers they had just fought off an ambush by foul swine clearly attempting to sabotage the Company's defences.
Having dealt with the creatures, we join Orin and Biron as they report the night's events to Sergeant Agata.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>Well, spit it out private. I don't have all day-- er night!</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Err, some sort of... pig-like creature...</p>
  <p>There were four of them. They took down the northwest tower.</p>
  <p>It sounds mad, I know. Ba is hiding outside with their corpses... and one captive.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">walks to the entrance of Agata's tent and gives a low cough before entering in behind Orin.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">creeps closer after the other two enter the tent and waits for a call.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">peers at Orin.</p>
  <p>Are you on the camp wine, private?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">coughs and puts an arm in front of their wineskin.</p>
  <p>Of course not...</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns to Biron.</p>
  <p>Corporal, what on earth are they talking about?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>Four infiltrators came. They attacked. We killed them, all but one.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">steps to the tent's door and opens it a little.</p>
  <p><span class="action">whispering</span> Come in, Ba.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>Ma’am, they do not appear to be human.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">steps in and drops the three dead creatures in one pile and the unconscious one in front of Agata.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd class="action">jumps back.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">coughs and looks at the beast men.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>WHY ARE YOU DUMPING DEAD LIVESTOCK....</p>
  <p>What the...</p>
  <p class="action">Her eyes narrow as she examines the dead creatures.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">holds himself up straight and waits.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>It's almost like what we faced in the Dismas sewers, but those were rats...</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns to the group.</p>
  <p>By the Bastard…</p>
  <p>Why. Have. YOU. DRESSED. DEAD. PIGS… AS SOLDIERS??</p>
  <p>DO YOU THINK I'M STUPID?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">steps back, shocked.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">grunts.</p>
  <p>You think so little of us, that you think we’d mess around like that?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">looks a little bit baffled. He walks to the unconscious beast man and kicks him to wake him, holding on to the back of him.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The creature squeals in its unconscious state before going limp again.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sighs, sits down, and pinches the bridge of her nose.</p>
  <p>If I'd known having you lot on patrol would be so much trouble, I'd have done it myself.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">looks at Ba, disapprovingly.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>You're expecting me to believe that... pigs... attacked us?</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">nudges Biron.</p>
  <p>Show her your sword.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>Wait ‘til it wakes. Inspect it... they carried blades and fired arrows.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks at Orin coldly.</p>
  <p>She's seen it.</p>
  <p class="action">He stands up straight again.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>Have the physician look over the dead. If you find us to be lying, you can punish us.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>The sword Biron found at the farm bears the same mark as the belt these creatures are wearing.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>Mark? What are you talking about, private?</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">produces the sword again for Agata.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">points to the belt buckle.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">examines the mark and shrugs.</p>
  <p>Indeed.</p>
  <p>Well... wake that creature up and give it a sword!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>They or some of their cohort must have killed the Livelys.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">nods.</p>
  <p>He goes to pick the pig man up and starts shaking it.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The bloodied creature soon awakens, and starts squealing and thrashing in agony, Its strange, hoof-like hands trying to reach around to grasp Biron.
Its black eyes filled with inhuman malevolence.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks at Orin.</p>
  <p>Dagger.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">gets close to the creature.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">passes a dagger over.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Listen! You have one chance... If you can kill this man you can go free.</p>
  <p class="action">points at Biron and steps back.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">takes his own sword out and gives dagger to pig man as was asked.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>Nod if you understand.</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Roll initiative, everyone.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan rolls 23 for Orin’s initiative.</p>
  <p>Chris rolls 17 for Biron’s initiative.</p>
  <p>Liam rolls 6 for Ba’s initiative.</p>
</aside>

<p>With desperate speed the dagger is snatched from Biron's hand. It gives no inkling it understands what you told it, but it immediately starts to move towards Biron.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">jumps back and raises his sword.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">looks to Agata and motions a hand.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">draws an arrow and points it at the creature, waiting.</p>
  <p>Don't try to run or attack anyone else.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Chris says, <q>I’m grabbing him by the scruff of the neck so he can still attack me easy, just can’t run.</q></p>
  <p>Chris rolls 18 for Biron’s Strength (Athletics) check to grapple the creature.</p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">growls at the pig and punches his chest. He puts the sword away and goes to grab the pig-man.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Biron easily grapples the thrashing creature just as it was about to make a dash through everyone's legs and to the tent exit.
It squeals inhuman curses at everyone.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">moves to cover any exit and prepares himself to grab the creature should Biron lose hold.</p>
  <p>You satisfied, Agata?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">has moved to the edge of the tent as far from the creature as she can, her face pale. She looks older than she's ever look before.</p>
  <p>Mother save us!</p>
  <p>Kill that thing!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">smiles and nods.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">tries to stop Biron.</p>
  <p>We need to find out if there are more. They are organised.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Ric says, “Make another Athletics check for Biron, please.”</p>
  <p>Chris rolls 8 for Biron’s Strength (Athletics) check to maintain his grapple on the creature.</p>
  <p class="break"></p>
  <p>Morgan says, “Eep! I still have my readied action!”</p>
  <p>Liam says, “Ba has a held action, too.”</p>
  <p>Ric says, “Okay Ba, make an Athletics check to try and grab him.”</p>
  <p>Liam rolls 11 for Ba’s Strength (Athletics) check to grapple the creature.</p>
  <p class="break"></p>
  <p>Morgan rolls 17 for Orin’s Shortbow sneak attack.</p>
  <p>Orin hits the creature for 15 piercing damage.</p>
</aside>

<p>The creature wriggles out of Biron's sweaty grip, drops to the floor and, with murderous intent, makes a run for Agata, leaping onto her desk...
...but not before Ba catches it in his grip.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>KILL THAT BLASTED THING!</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">hesitates for just a second, looking between Agata and Ba, before finally releasing their arrow.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Orin’s arrow sends the creature flying, pinning it against one of the tent’s wooden poles where is hangs limply, looking like a discarded toy.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd class="action">stands very still before slowly sitting down at her desk.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">goes back to full upright position and steps back again, awaiting Agata.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd class="action">sits very quietly, clearly thinking hard.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The silence is deafening.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">holds their bow awkwardly in front of them, trying to look anywhere but at Agata or the corpses and fiddling with the cork of their wineskin.</dd>
</dl>

<p>After a short while, she speaks, so quietly you can barely hear.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Fetch Corporal Loth.</p>
  <p>Now.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">nods and heads out to find Loth.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">follows.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">stands in the tent looking helpless, staring at the ceiling.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Ba and Biron easily locate Loth who sleeps in his smaller tent close to Agata's. He looks angry at being awoken, but nods and gestures for you to lead the way.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">leads him back to Agata.</dd>

<dt>Corporal Loth</dt>
<dd class="action">strides into the tent ahead of Biron and Ba and stops, taking in the scene.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">walks alongside both men, quiet and stern looking. Back in the tent, he again holds his usual position and waits instruction.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">beckons Loth over and he cautiously approaches.</p>
  <p class="action">She whispers to him, he nods and starts scribbling something down on paper.</p>
  <p class="action">She stares at the paper for what seems like another age.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">suddenly looks agitated, waving an arm over their shoulder.</p>
  <p><span class="action">muttering</span> Shut up!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">raises an eyebrow at Orin, but ignores the interruption and continues to stare intently at the paper Loth has written on.</p>
  <p class="action">mutters under her breath.</p>
  <p>Witch Queens! Orcs!</p>
  <p class="action">She harrumphs.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">tilts his head slightly at this name.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>You have to believe us. There are also rat people under Dismas.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">looks confused.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Quiet, corporal!</p>
  <p class="action">She seems strangely stiff, formal with Ba in a way she isn't normally.</p>
  <p><span class="action">standing up</span> Attention!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">stands to attention.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">stands to attention.</dd>

<dt>Corporal Loth</dt>
<dd class="action">stands to attention and salutes immediately.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">stands taller, but is otherwise unsure of how to conduct themself.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>This is how this is going to go:</p>
  <p>First thing, no one is to mention anything about these... creatures to anyone else.</p>
  <p>Do you all understand me?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">nods dumbly.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">gives solid nod.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">nods stiffly.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>If anyone so much as mentions the word ‘orc’ I'll have them court-martialed and executed so fast, your shit will still be warm in your pants when they bury you!</p>
  <p>Understand?!</p>
  <p>And I want a ‘yes, ser’!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>What's an orc?</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>Yes, ser.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">gives second nod.</p>
  <p><span class="action">loudly growling</span> Yes, ser.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Er, yes ser?</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">glowers so hard at Orin they can almost imagine the room getting hotter.</p>
  <p>Do not try me, private!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Couldn't imagine it, ser.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">gives Orin a sharp and angry look.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Secondly, you are to strip these bodies, wrap them up in sacks and dispose of them in the lime pits.</p>
  <p>No one, and I mean no one, is to see these bodies!</p>
  <p>Understood?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>Yes, ser.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks at Biron.</p>
  <p>Errr...</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>Yes, ser.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">gives Ba a pleading look.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">closes his eyes and nods.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Yes, ser?</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>Let me be clear: if word gets out that... these... things... monsters are attacking the camp, we'll have so many desertions this place will look like the king's chamber pot.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">nods again.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Yes, ser.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>We will be on it, right away.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">coughs awkwardly.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">bows and moves toward the still hanging body of the orc.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Ser, we need a better warning system... a bell or something. At the moment I’ve told all to use fire arrows but it’s not great. And maybe lanterns should be set up at the base of all the towers.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Chris whispers to the Ric, <q>When everyone leaves the tent, I’d like Biron to stay for a quick moment.</q></p>
  <p>Ric replies, <q>Do you want the other players to be aware or do you want to roleplay it in private?</q></p>
  <p>Chris replies, <q>Err, they can be. I don’t think it’ll matter much. It’s more so Biron doesn’t get interrupted.</q></p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">pauses a moment and thinks about something before carrying on with his task.</dD>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">begins stripping the bodies.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">stands at 'attention' a little longer, unsure how to react, but eventually takes the others' lead and starts removing weapons and gear from the creatures.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>I didn't dismiss you yet!</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">stops.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">drops everything in their hands and stands straight up with their hands close against their thighs.</dd>

<dt>Sergeant Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Corporal Ba, I'll take that into consideration but I have a lot... to think about.</p>
  <p>After you've done that break your fast, get some rest, and report to me immediately before you start your patrol tonight.</p>
  <p>And... good work.</p>
  <p>Dismissed!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">bows low.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">looks even more confused at the compliment.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>Thank you, ser.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Ba'Raknul continues to strip and wrap the bodies in whatever is available, revealing the strangely pale, wormlike forms beneath.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">helps Ba and Biron finish up.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">hauls up as many as he can carry.</p>
  <p>Orin, lead the way and make sure we don’t run into anyone.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Morgan rolls 21 for Orin’s Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
  <p>Morgan rolls 10 for Orin’s Dexterity (Stealth) check.</p>
  <p>Liam rolls 22 for Ba’s Dexterity (Stealth) check.</p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">pokes their head out the tent flap to look for observers.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Outside, dawn is breaking. The rest of the camp stirs, but the fetches work on a different schedule and this part of the camp is still quiet.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">waves for the others to follow, then heads for the north gate using the tents for cover.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">follows Orin out once they give the signal.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">remains standing at attention to Agata after Ba and Orin have left the tent.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>What is it, Corporal Biron?</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Ma'am, one thought I'd like to add.</p>
  <p>The boy, from the farm… they got attacked by possibly the same creatures. It's where I found this sword. You may want to keep a watch on the boy so he doesn't spread rumours of what he saw.</p>
  <p>It will probably be seen as confusion and imagination, but I would like this to be brought to your attention.</p>
  <p class="action">He bows and nods</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">nods.</p>
  <p>I'll have him isolated and guarded.</p>
  <p>Thank you, Corporal Biron.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">gives a nod and leaves to follow the group.</p>
  <p class="action">He jogs slightly to catch up with the rest.</p>
  <p>We need bags to wrap the bodies.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stops to think for a second.</p>
  <p>Sacks from mess should do it.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>I'll get them.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Meet us outside the north gate, in the ditch. Don't want the guards seeing.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">nods as he leaves, diverting to pick up sacks from the mess.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The party smells the limepit well before they see its grim contents. As they leave the West Gate they spy a detail of privates throwing today's bodies into the foul crevasse. They all have their faces wrapped in cloth to stifle the stench and allay disease.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">whispering</span> Let’s hide and wait.</p>
  <p>They’ll leave.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Can we get to the wood's edge?</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">looks around for somewhere to hide.</dd>
</dl>

<p>It would be easy to make it to the treeline without being seen.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">grunts and nods toward the woods.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">waves for the others to follow.</p>
  <p class="action">They duck into the treeline to hide in wait.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">grunts.</p>
  <p>Keep your guard up.</p>
  <p class="action">He extinguishes any torches we have before hiding in the tree line.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">follows stealthily.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The party squats amidst the trees and scrubs at the edge of Friar's Wood while the privates on lime pit duty work slowly and begrudgingly. The corporal in Ba and Biron bristle at the idea of such indiscipline but after a while they finish their work and trudge back to camp, removing their improvised face masks and grumbling to each other</p>

<p>The coast is soon clear!</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd><span class="action">whispering</span> We should cover our faces.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">gives a single nod and pulls up a cloth to put around his face.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">pulls up his bandana.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>I lost my spare shirt to the boy's arm...</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">rolls his eyes and shakes his head, not even looking at Orin.</p>
  <p>We move.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">pulls up their shirt from under their leather armour, getting it only just over their nose.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">begins slowly moving to the pit.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">steps forwards with two of the bodies in a bag then moves quietly and quickly to the lime pit.</dd>
</dl>

<p>As the party approaches the lip of the pit, the sight that befalls them is like something from hell itself. A jumble of human bodies, squirming yet still. A dismembered hand pokes out from under a face here.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">looks at the bodies and just grunts and shrugs the bodies off.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">falters at the sight.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The sacks drop onto the mess, make a squelching sound that makes everyone shudder. And with that they join the still masses in the pit below.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Should we... I dunno... cover them with something?</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I don’t know if it’s needed at this point.</p>
  <p class="action">He bows his head.</p>
  <p>This is no way to go.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Chris whispers, <q>Can I push Orin in? :D</q></p>
  <p>Ric replies, <q>Ha ha.</q></p>
  <p class=”break”></p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>Awh! Could we not do a roll to see if they went in?</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>… no… Sorry, hard limit on swimming in corpses… you weirdo 😉</q></p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>Haha! Well, Orin did say maybe we should cover it. Biron thought it was funny, lol.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>Hehe.</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Barbarian humour.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>Asshole, more like.</q></p>

<h5>Scene VI: Ba's Test</h5>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">fights off the waves of tiredness as he makes his way towards Der Vynge’s tent. Passing a bucket of water, he dunks his head and moves quickly on.</dd>

<p>Ba finds Der Vynge sitting outside his tent over a bucket of water. He carefully trims the strange goatee beard he sports. He doesn't seem to acknowledge Ba’s arrival at all.</p>

<dd>Musket?</dd>

  <p>My apologies, ser. I do not have one.</p>

  <p>Liam says, <q>Can I take a round to aim for advantage? Is that a thing?</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Checking now… Hmmm no… but I’ll make a ruling and allow you to burn a ki point to get advantage.</q></p>

  <p>Liam says, <q>I know it’s gonna have to be a loan or favour or stolen, lol.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>I’m sure Ba can lower himself to stealing one from somewhere?</q></p>
  <p>Liam says, <q>I was thinking that or beg Agata, hahaha. I don’t think he can steal. He can, but he won’t.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>Lol, like she gives a shit about a musket. Biron or Orin will just have to steal one for him, then.</q></p>
  <p>Liam says, <q>Hahaha, thanks.</q></p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>Lmao, as long as there’s good reason for Biron to do it, or he believes it’s an order. He’ll get one, but yea, he does tend to have an outlook of ‘the end justifies the means’.</q></p>

<h5>Scene VII: Night 2</h5>

<p>The party awakes that evening from a dark sleep, not feeling exactly refreshed, but certainly ready. The calls are going out for last meal of the day from the mess.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">rolls out from his bed and stretches with a mighty yawn. It almost sounds like a deep bark. He gets ready and heads to the food hall.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sits meditating and slowly eating some rations.</p>
  <p class="action">He eventually heads out to the food hall, eyes about for rifles or someone that might have access.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Ba looks around for stray muskets but, given their value, the only ones he sees are sported by the musketeers, who always carry them around and never let them leave their sight. Each one is distinctive as well, so not easily missed and even more easily recognised.</p>

<p>Biron arrives at the mess hall. The usual suspects are gathered in their various cliques: infantrymen here, fetches there, clerks, musketeers, and Hyde’s fetches all alone.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">gets a plate of food and goes to sit in a back corner, alone as normal, and eats glaring out across the mess quietly.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The mess is all a murmur about the fallen tower. A group of infantrymen speculate as to who night have felled it. A young woman mentions something about pigs, but the rest laugh it off, much to the lass' humiliation.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">stares at them all suspiciously. He thinks to himself... One of them, maybe more, is a traitor.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">heads in and sits by Biron.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">eats his food in silence, doesn’t even acknowledge Ba.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">doesn’t immediately go to mess after waking up.</p>
  <p class="action">The breakfast bell causes them to roll over on their camp bed, groaning. As they do their arm falls over their pack and they are suddenly reminded about the strange weapons they took from the pig men.</p>
  <p class="action">They reach for the sword strapped to their bag and remove it, looking it over while laying on their cot.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Like Biron's sword, it’s made of a strange steel. At first Orin thinks it is covered in soot, but if it has been blackened by flame, its somehow now part of the steel.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">holds the shortsword in their hand and gives it a few swings to feel its weight.</dd>
</dl>

<p>It feels much like any shortsword, though the blade is wicked and Orin nearly cut themselves swishing it. If they didn't know better they'd say it... hated Orin?</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">gives it a perplexed look, but sits up, sets the sword down, and picks up the bow.</dd>
</dl>

<p>It seems much like any shortbow, although made of the same metal, but it appears to have the suppleness of your own, wooden bows. Very strange.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">gives the bow's string a tug.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The string itself seems made of metal, but springs as easily as any freshly strung bow. Otherwise, you feel no abnormal effects.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">frowns at the bow and tosses it across the tent.</p>
  <p class="action">As they get dressed they carefully replace the rapier in their belt with the strange shortsword, hoping it will prove itself to be as useful as Biron's new weapon.</p>
  <p class="action">They then head to mess for the evening meal, joining Biron and Ba.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Tonight's meal is grey gruel, described as ‘rabbit stew’. It tastes of anything but. A meal only the hungry would eat. The group reluctantly gulps it down and leave the mess.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">We need to head in for patrol.</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Ric whispers, <q>It occurs to Biron that the metal of his longsword is the same as the javelins he recovered from the strange attack in the night when he was travelling to Whitehaven.</q></p>
  <p>Chris replies, <q>I don’t remember them at all. But I’ll go with it, lol!</q></p>
  <p>Ric replies, <q>I think it was you, but my memory is fuzzy. You did travel to Whiterock?</q></p>
  <p>Chris replies, <q>I have no idea. I know we fought the orcs before, in the woods when they were hitting out our torch lights with a bow.</q></p>
  <p>Ric replies, <q>I recall you collected the javelins they threw, but maybe that was Ba.</q></p>
  <p>Chris replies, <q>It’s very possible, so for story’s sake I can just carry on?</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Yes.</q></p>
  <p class="break"></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>Orin is adverse to replacing their bow with any other. Is it possible they can study the strange one to learn how to make their own better? That’s their background, Guild Artisan (bowyer) with woodcarving tools proficiency. It seemed the most relevant from the list.</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Okay, make a DC 15 check to see if you can understand the strange shortbow.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan rolls 21 for Orin’s Woodcarving Tools check.</p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">growls and, again without words, goes back to his tent. He has started thinking about some javelins he picked up on a previous mission.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">stands and heads out to collect his stuff for watch.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Of course. I'll meet you at Agata's... there's just one more thing I need to do.</p>
  <p class="action">They head back with a thoughtful look on their face, to their tent where they pick up the shortbow again and inspect it’s crafting.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Orin has an idea about how to make similar, metallic strings that never need restringing, but they’ll need fletcher’s tools and access to a smithy.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">leaves the bow behind again, satisfied with what they learnt, and goes to find a familiar face at the fetches' fire. They makes a secret exchange with them, replacing one of their skins with another that looks considerably more full.</p>
  <p class="action">They then go to meet the others at Agata's tent.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">gets back to his tent and looks around to some of his ‘trophies’.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">gets his stuff and heads to Agata’s.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">searches for and finds some javelins from the journey his and Ba's group took a while ago. He remembers these were used by the beast men back then, like his new sword.</p>
  <p class="action">He picks one up.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>They are made of the same, strange blackened metal as the unsettling sword.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">steps out with his Javelin. He feels the weight of it, then launches it at a clear area.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The javelin aims true and lands with a dull and ominous twang. Several heads turn, some shaking, but otherwise nothing abnormal happens.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">shrugs and goes to pick it up, seeming a little disappointed, but keeps the javelin, and the others from his tent, for a fight if needed.</p>
  <p class="action">He then heads to Agata's tent.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Without his usual contempt, Loth shows the into the warm, smoke-filled interior Agata's tent. She stands with her back turned to the group, smoking her pipe. A young man stands in the corner, a private.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">stands in silence and to attention.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">comes in, salutes, and stands to attention.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">fondles the cork of their wineskin, standing awkwardly.</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd><span class="action">turns around</span> Private, corporals. It appears we have a new adversary...</dd>
