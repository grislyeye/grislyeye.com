<p>We're looking for imaginative players to join my official, playtest campaign, <em>Black Griffin</em>. This will be a <strong>play-by-chat only</strong> game using 5th edition <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Games will start at 4pm GMT (negotiable) on Sundays. The setting is low-magic grimdark. Sorry, no elf or wizard characters unless you have a <a href="unique-backgrounds.html">unique background</a>.</p>

<p>You will start the campaign as mercenaries in the employ of the infamous Company of the Black Griffin. Lowly even for sellswords, you have been placed on punishment duty as company <em>fetches</em>: bounty hunters charged with capture of deserters for trial.</p>

<p>As players you'll get access to some of our pre-release material. Plus <strong>free</strong> copies of final products you playtest with. playtest credits.</p>

<p>If you'd like to join <a href="mailto:info@grislyeye.com?subject=[blackgriffin] Application">email us</a> with the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A short introduction about yourself and your roleplaying experience.</li>

</ul>
