<p>We're looking for imaginative players to join my official, playtest campaign, <em>Black Griffin</em>. This will be a <strong>play-by-chat only</strong> game using 5th edition <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Games will start at 4pm GMT (negotiable) on Sundays. The setting is low-magic grimdark. Sorry, no elf or wizard characters unless you have a <a href="unique-backgrounds.html">unique background</a>.</p>

<p>You will start the campaign as mercenaries in the employ of the infamous [Company of the Black Griffin](black-griffin-preview-1.html). Lowly even for sellswords, you have been placed on punishment duty as company <em>fetches</em>: bounty hunters charged with capture of deserters for trial.</p>

<p>As playtesters you'll get access to pre-release Grisly Eye Games material. Plus <strong>free</strong> copies of final products you playtest. With playtest credits!</p>
