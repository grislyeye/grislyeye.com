<h3> The Fey Exile</h3>

<p>The fey are as capricious and as they are unforgiving. You were the victim of such a change of heart. Perhaps you were a favoured courtier. A guardian of the Old Ways. Or maybe you were a pet, kept against your will.</p>

<p>Now you are exiled from  the fair woods and halls of the fey. You find yourself lost in unfamiliar lands. Yet not all is lost. A little fey magic still lingers with you.</p>

<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Elven and Sylvan</p>

<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Arcana, Persuasion.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A set of fine clothes, an item of clothing with a strange flourish, like a hat with a feather, a fairy trinket and a purse containing 25 gp.</p>

<p>You may now choose from the following options at character creation:</p>

<p><strong>Races:</strong> Changeling, Elf, Fey, Gnome, or Half-elf.</p>

<p><strong>Classes:</strong> Arcane Trickster, Bard, Druid, Eldritch Knight, Fey Pact Warlock, Ranger, Wild Magic Origin Sorcerer, or Wizard.</p>

<p><strong>Feats:</strong> Lucky, or Magic Initiate</p>

<h4>Reason for Exile</h4>

<p>Why were you exiled? Maybe you fell in love with the wrong person? Maybe you were tricked? Or maybe you were merely the victim of random, faery caprice? You can work with your DM to come up with the exact reason for your exile, or you can choose or roll on the table below.</p>

<h4>Unique Flaw: Curse</h4>

<p>The fey are nothing if not vengeful when wronged. Not only were you exiled but, out of pure spite, a curse was placed on you. You can roll on the following table to determine your curse, or choose one that best fits your character.</p>

    </tr>

<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>

<p>Even mortal exiles are touched by the wildness of the fey. Exiles can exhibit fey caprice and whimsy. And trauma from exile or fairy imprisonment can leave mental scars.</p>
