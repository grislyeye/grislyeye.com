<p><strong>Status:</strong> Concept</p>

<p>An adventure for <a href="https://goblinarchives.itch.io/liminal-horror">Liminal Horror</a> and <a href="https://evlyn.itch.io/liminal-high-school">Liminal High School</a>, in the genre of gig-work horror.</p>

<p>Being a teenager on a zero-hour contract is tough, but then you get stuck in a remote gas station during a snow storm, just as the really weird shit starts to go down. Can you weather the night or are you just another casualty of the gig economy?</p>

<p>Inspired by creepy-pasta, the <span class="product">KULT</span> roleplaying game, <span class="product">John Dies at the End</span> and <span class="product">This Book is Full of Spiders</span> by David Wong, <span class="product">Hellraiser</span> (1987), the <span class="product">Tales from the Gas Station</span> podcast, <span class="product">A Colder War</span> by Charles Stross and the TV series <span class="product">Utopia</span>.</p>
