<p>In low-fantasy, magic is rare: the gods are distant, the fey are in retreat and superstition is widespread. Non-human characters with magical abilities are the exception, not the rule.</p>

<p>A unique background represents a rare or special origin that gives your character access to magical races or classes (or feats) in a way that is sympathetic to low-fantasy campaigns.</p>

<p class="description"><span class="product">Unique Backgrounds</span> introduces variant rules for low-fantasy characters. It is free/pay-what-you-want so that other <span class="title">Dungeon Masters Guild</span> publishers can create their own unique backgrounds.</p>
