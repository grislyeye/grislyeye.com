<p>This is the <em>third</em> campaign diary for my 5th Edition D&amp;D playtest campaign, <strong>Black Griffin</strong>. Black Griffin is a play-by-chat game that runs every week on Roll20. The party are mercenaries in the employ of the infamous Company of the Black Griffin. Lowly even for sellswords, they have been placed on punishment duty as company <q>fetches</q>: bounty hunters charged with capture of deserters for trial.</p>

<p>The below is an edited log from of our <q>in-character</q> chat channel. We've added annotations so you can follow what's going on. Please enjoy!</p>

<h5>Scene III: The Infirmary (Continued)</h5>

<p>When we last left our band of misfit mercenaries they had made it back to camp by nightfall with the unconscious body of the wounded boy. Waved through by the mercenaries on guard at the North Gate, they quickly made their way to the infirmary, which is manned this evening by Physick Vicmas.</p>

<p>This impossibly short man bears what appears to be a monks tonsure on his head. He demands payment to treat the child...</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stares death-like and whispers coldly in Vicmas‚Äô ear</p>
  <p>You want the gold. take it. But if the kid dies? Not a guard in here can protect you... from... me.!</p>
  <p class="action">pushes him back and drops 10gp on the ground</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Begrudgingly, Vicmas sweeps up Biron's gold and his orderlies sweep the boy up and carry him into the the infirmary tent.</p>

<p>Within is dark and gloomy. The stench of waste and death lingers and the low sound of groaning and suffering is pervasive.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Vicmas</dt>
<dd>
  <p>How did this happen?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>An attack‚Ä¶ and fire.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>We don‚Äôt know what exactly happened. The farm was in tatters and we only found him.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stands in the corner silently, gripping their dagger with white knuckles and shooting more from their eyes</p>
</dd>

<dt>Vicmas</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">leans in closer to examine the boy‚Äôs missing arm</p>
  <p>I've never seen a war wound cut this clean and even!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">sighs deeply</span> It looked like who ever it was fled over the front line... They may have taken the family.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>And I saw no evidence of the arm.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stares towards Orin</p>
  <p><span class="action">stepping away from Vicmas</span> You still have that sword?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">growls</span> What sword?</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Chris says, <q>Biron found the sword, it's his trophy.</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Very well.</q></p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>You said it seemed familiar, but I don&#39;t know why. So I wanna look at it more.</q></p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>The black sword I gave you.</p>
  <p class="action">stares with his normal aggressive look, looking Orin straight in the face</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">Takes the pack off without taking their eyes from Vicmas. They reach in and pull out the wrapped sword, handing it to Biron.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks at the sword for a moment and studies it a little more then last time</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Something deep within Biron&#39;s bowels cringes as he hold the weapon. It is made of some kind of metal, like steel but blackened as if by soot. Its jagged edges bear a cruel, sharp edge and it bears a half-lidded eye on its hilt. The metal seems vaguely familiar to Biron.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Vicmas</dt>
<dd>
  <p>By the Father! Where did you get that?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">looks at Vicmas</span> It was dropped.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">seeing the physicians reaction</span> What do you know of it?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Vicmas</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I've never seen its like before.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stares at the blade, unwraps it and spins it in his hand, checking its balance, and running fingers over the smooth side of the blade</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Biron feels a sudden stab of cold in his hand, like the life being sucked out of him! So fearsome is the shock, he drops the blade on the ground.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">looks to Orin, still seething</span> Orin, could you go let Agata know... We are supposed to be on duty tonight and we haven‚Äôt reported in yet.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">takes a step toward the physick</p>
  <p>You should worry more about the boy's flesh than this hunk of metal.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">steps a little closer to Orin</p>
  <p>Please, Orin.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">grunts, looking a little unsure about the sword</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>As soon as it is out of your hand, the feeling goes. It was a great weariness, but also power...</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">growls</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">ignores Ba</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">kneels down to look at the sword</p>
  <p class="action">sniffs</p>
</dd>

<dt>Vicmas</dt>
<dd>
  <p>This is no place for weapon practice, begone from my infirmary!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">goes to pick the sword back up</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Take a level of exhaustion for Biron, please.</q></p>
  <p>Liam says, <q>LOL, don‚Äôt pick up obviously cursed swords.</q></p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>Biron is finding this out.</q></p>
</aside>

<p>This time, ready for the shock, Biron can just about bear the weapon in his hands, but he feels an impossible weariness about him.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Vicmas</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">bustles about the boy, preparing a hot stave to seal the wound</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sighs at Orin and turns to Biron</p>
  <p>I am going to stay here and make sure the boy is ok... Can you report in to Agata for me?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">Seems to not hear Ba at first and lets out a groan when touching the sword again. He stumbles to his feet.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">whispers to no one over their shoulder</span> I may, if he isn't careful.</p>
  <p>Such beady little eyes.</p>
  <p>He's like a beetle, storing away its dung for later.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>We get it Orin, you don‚Äôt like him.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Vicmas</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">shoos Ba away</p>
  <p>Visitors only for one hour after dawn. Lieutenant Vin‚Äôs orders!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">walks out of the tent without saying a word, holding the sword and the cloth</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">moves to the entrance of the tent and waits a moment</p>
  <p>Once outside, he ponders a second before turning on the spot sitting down and waiting, not on the path but outside the tent.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">to no one</span> Well I won't if he fixes the boy.</p>
  <p>No, you won't either. Shut up.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Vicmas</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">eyes Orin carefully and mutters something about shock under his breath</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Not this time, toad. I said shut up!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">paying no attention to anyone, wanders in the dark a moment staring at the blade</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Biron feels rather than hears a low hum, as though the sword were speaking to him, though he cannot understand what it might say. He feels weary but, as he swings the sword, it gives easily in his hand, slashing with surprising speed and strength.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">moving with the sword, whispers to himself</span> Smooth, quick, powerful.</p>
  <p class="action">looks around to see the others, placing the sword into the cloth and putting it away</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Ric says, <q>You lose your level of exhaustion.</q></p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>Huh? Oh this is gonna be fun.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>LOL</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>You have a <em>draining +1 longsword</em>. Please add it to your character sheet.</q></p>
  <p>Liam says, <q>Nice.</q></p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>üëå</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>üëè</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>A popular choice, LOL. I think you can figure out how it works.</q></p>
</aside>

<p>Instantly the weariness leaves Biron, as does the power.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks around and suddenly acknowledges what Ba asked him to do. He starts to walk to Agata&#39;s tent</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Back at the Physick‚Äôs tent‚Ä¶</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">loosens their grip on the dagger and starts pacing along one wall inside the tent</p>
</dd>

<dt>Vicmas</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">pokes his head out of the tent</p>
  <p>Can you do something about this person?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">opens one eye</span> ORIN! Get some rest. We have patrol later and the man needs to work... sithout you there.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>What if he kills the boy? Or does anything else underhanded to him?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Then I will be here and he will not.</p>
  <p>He was paid and is here for the camp.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I can stay.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Then you can stay out here with me.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">Thinks hard while watching Vicmas work. They fidget, undecided, but eventually go outside with Ba.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">opens his eyes and motions next to him</span> Do you wish to meditate with me?</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>It is getting late, past dusk, and Ba and Orin&#39;s stomachs growl. If they do not make it to the mess &quot;hall&quot; in the next half-hour or so, they&#39;ll miss the evening meal.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>The growl of his stomach causes him to become aware of the lack of food.</p>
  <p>I dont know about you... but I could eat.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Go, eat. I&#39;ve got a ration in my pack.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stands. Just before leaving he places a hand on Orins shoulder.</p>
  <p>He will be okay... I&#39;ll leave him under your watch.</p>
  <p>He smiles once more and then heads towards the mess hall.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I just don&#39;t understand how people end up like that.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">as he walks</span> Just don‚Äôt let their choices change you.</p>
  <p>He disappears between the tents.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Ba weaves his way through the tents, the smell of fires and pipe smoke drifting in the air. About him mercenaries are filtering back from the mess and chatting amongst themselves as though the evening is about to get started.</p>

<aside>
  <p>Liam says, <q>Do I see any of the musketeers that could train me?</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>A couple in the musketeers&#39; corner.</q></p>
  <p>Liam says, <q>I‚Äôm looking mainly for the woman or the guy who doesn‚Äôt speak common very well.</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>The musketeers who might train you include: One-Eyed John, Lieutenant Freya, and Der Vynge.</q></p>
</aside>

<p>Ba reaches the mess as dinner is winding up. There are still a few malingerers sternly eating the modest fare while they swap tales with each other. He is given a bowl of stew and a hunk of bread. He can see several groups of people sitting together. Fetches in one corner. Hyde&#39;s fetches nearby, but separate, listening to the toad bloviate to them. Walter&#39;s clerks sneaking in to grab some food while the main soldiers are away. Huddles of infantrymen here and there. And, of course, the musketeers sitting in one corner all to themselves</p>

<p>Where does Ba&#39;Raknul sit?</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">scans the room before slowly heading over towards the musketeers</p>
  <p class="action">as he gets close he nods to any that look up</p>
  <p>Mind if I join you?</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>They look at Ba warily and say nary a word. After a while they get up and leave... Clearly they don&#39;t welcome the company of non-musketeers, which includes Ba, for the time being.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sighs and quietly eats, listening to conversations and observing the different groups</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Meanwhile, Biron makes his way to Agata&#39;s tent. As he goes to enter he is surprised! Loth jumps out, point his silvered sword at Biron&#39;s neck.</p>

<p>Loth realises who it is and puts the sword down before ushering Biron inside.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">growls and goes for a grapple before stopping himself</p>
  <p class="action">snarls viciously towards Loth</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">calls from inside the tent</span> Please do not snap at my corporal. And get in here.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">his growls grow softer and he walks in</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Biron find yourself in the familiar confines of Agata&#39;s tent, except it seems upturned. Papers cover the floor. Chest are left open and their contents scattered. A slash opens one side of the tent.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks confused and looks around, but remains silent</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I&#39;ve been robbed, so it seems!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">snarls in low, angry voice</span> Thieves.</p>
  <p>When?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">rolls her eyes</p>
  <p>No camp thief would be stupid enough to steal from me, corporal.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">pauses a moment and thinks</p>
  <p>The farm was attacked, people slaughtered. Boy is in Viscus&#39;s tent. Maybe same people?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">nods</span> That is unfortunate, but we have more important things to worry about.</p>
  <p>Only papers are missing... This is the work of spies.</p>
  <p>Here.</p>
  <p>In the camp!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">snarls</p>
  <p class="action">stops and considers his next words carefully</p>
  <p>A sword was found at the premises. Might be from the group that did this?</p>
  <p class="action">He slowly, and slightly unwillingly, pulls sword out to show her.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">raises her eyebrow</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Or the boy may help.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>That is one ugly sword, Corporal. But perhaps you are right.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, whoever did this was disturbed before they could get away with anything important.</p>
  <p>Loth walked in and scared them off.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Loth</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stalks into the tent, nods at Agata, and starts searching the room carefully</p>
</dd>

<aside>
  <p>Chris says, <q>Maybe a bit of a stretch but can I insight Loth?</q>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Of course, if you like. Let&#39;s say... DC 18</q>
  <p>Chris rolls 22 for Biron&#39;s Wisdom (Insight) check to see if Loth is hiding anything.</p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>KABOOM!</q>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>Nice.</q>
  <p>Liam says, <q>Nice.</q>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Blimey.</q>
  <p>Liam says, <q>Case blown wide open ha ha ha ha!</q>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>LOL!</q>
  <p>Liam says, <q>Detective Biron on the case.</q>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sniffs and looks at Loth</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Normally unreadable, even Biron can read the genuine concern furrowing Loth&#39;s normally smooth brow. If he&#39;s guilty of anything, he&#39;s hiding it well.</p>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I already debriefed Loth. Black cloaks, bearing the griffin on their arms.</p>
  <p>They could be anyone in the camp.</p>
  <p>Did you think it would be that easy?</p>
  <p>While you&#39;re on patrol, keep your eyes and ears keen.</p>

  <p>What is that?</p>
  <p>A feather? Could be a clue. Or just a feather.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Do we know what they were after? and what has gone missing?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Do you think I recall every piece of paper. It matters not. Any scrap here could be nothing... Or could mean victory in the war.</p>
  <p>This can&#39;t happen again.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Chris says, <q>This is the most talking Biron has ever done... It hurts!</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>What doesn&#39;t kill you makes you stronger.</q></p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>He says short and concise things.</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>I&#39;m sure he&#39;s very angry with Ba and Orin for not being there to do the talking üòõ</q></p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>He was told to debrief her, cos you didn&#39;t go, LOL!</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>Uh oh, there&#39;s a grudge forming.</q></p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>Biron has a mixture of feelings towards Orin. Sometimes he thinks they&#39;re little more then a common thief and a nuisance. Other times he thinks they&#39;re rather skilled.</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Where do you guys want to meet up?</q></p>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>Probably best to catch up back at the infirmary. I don&#39;t think Orin&#39;s going to move.</q></p>
  <p>Liam says, <q>If Biron makes it to mess hall before it closes, then there. But if it shuts before then I will head to the infirmary.</q>
  <p>Chris says, <q>Biron was trying to make this decision. But I think he will be going for food first, in a rush, and eat while walking.</q></p>
  <p>Liam says, <q>In which case I will see him when he arrives and we can go to see Orin together.</q>
  <p>Ric says, <q>The mess will still be open, although only the dregs of the stew will be available. Where the <em>heaviest</em> scraps sink...</q></p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>Meh, Biron is used to animal over fire. I&#39;m sure bits of a stew will be fine.</q></p>

<p>Biron&#39;s stomach starts to growl in earnest, this is the longest he has spoken or gone without a meal!</p>

  <p>Before leaving to go elsewhere, he checks round the side of the tent that was slashed to look for footprints.</p>

<p>There are footprints, several, in fact a surfeit. Before Biron‚Äôs eyes a drunken soldier stumbles past, sinking her boots into the mud and obliterating the prints with a new set.</p>

  <p class="action">snarls</p>

<p>Biron swings by the mess. He gulps down the last straggles of stew, taking some time to chew on the heaviest scraps that sink to the bottom.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">snarls and pours the food down, making a mess of his face</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>As he and Ba sit together they overhear some of the more veteran strugglers, hard men for whom hard stew is no hard work, muttering to each other.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stops and listens carefully</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The men complain that it&#39;s been months, even years, since the front with the Commonwealth has moved. They say this grim war is a farce, and the Black Griffins might be camped here for many moons to come.</p>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>

<p>The grim mercenaries around them seem too concerned with their own problems to pay any mind to a couple of wretched fetches. You hear murmurs of how Barnstable has been a waystation for Royalist forces for so long it&#39;s growing in size to compare to Dismas. Someone grumbles it even has its own thieves&#39; council!</p>

<p>Another grumble that if the Commonwealth folk are so cursed as the priests claim, why do they still stand against the righteous forces of the Three Kings?</p>

<p>Perhaps these are just the complaints of folk who have seen too much war.</p>

<h5>Scene IV: Night 1</h5>

<p>The party finds their way to the south gate, past the mishmash and chaos of the camp follower tents. Many have closed for the day, but even more are just starting their commerce.</p>

<p>The wooden barricade stands fifteen feet tall and sturdy, the wood still fresh from being felled. Every so often a wooden tower stands sentry against the darkness beyond, although the two towers here seem unmanned.</p>

<p>South is the blasted mud and gorse of the front. If this ever was green, the grass and trees here have long gone.</p>

  <p>Liam says, <q>Hmmm, okay.</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Saving throw on each turn to end the effect. DC 12 Dexterity.</q></p>
  <p>Liam says, <q>Oh no worries. Although, a minute. What do you guys think? I am confident Ba can pass that.</q></p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>I&#39;m confident Ba can pass that but one bad roll and you&#39;re effectively outta combat.</q></p>

<p>As Biron looks outside the fence, he sees the deep ditches dug in front of the barricades. Another defence, but one that makes it hard to scale the walls. They have been dug all around the camp.</p>

<p>The party passes through the fetch camp, where only the hardiest drinkers and gamblers remain. Otherwise, all seems quiet.
They next pass the edges of the east camp. This is where the newer recruits tend to bunk. For this reason it is the rowdiest and most chaotic area of the camp. Drinking and games go on long into the night.</p>

<p>Despite the rowdy noise coming from the thicket of tents and campfires, Ba sees nothing untoward. Well, there a couple of mercenaries drunkenly throwing punches at one another before falling about each other kissing and... well.
