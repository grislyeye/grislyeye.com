<p>This is the first campaign diary for my 5th Edition D&amp;D playtest campaign, <strong>Black Griffin</strong>. Black Griffin is a play-by-chat game that runs every week on Roll20. The party are mercenaries in the employ of the infamous Company of the Black Griffin. Lowly even for sellswords, they have been placed on punishment duty as company <q>fetches</q>: bounty hunters charged with capture of deserters for trial.</p>

<p>The below is an edited log from of our <q>in-character</q> chat channel. We've added annotations so you can follow what's going on. Please enjoy!</p>

<h4>Camp Patrol Act I</h4>

<p>After escaping the clutches of Royalist interrogators, our band of misfit fetches find their way back to the Black Griffin Encampment and spend a week unwinding.</p>

<p>However, as you relax the rest of the camp is gearing up. The Company's Royalist clients are gathering forces for a push against the Commonwealth.</p>

<h5>Scene I: The Debriefing</h5>

<p>You awaken the next morn, ready to report to Agata for your debriefing.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>wakes early enough to finish off his new scar… added to the scars he already has, then heads over to Agata's tent</p>

<dt>Orin</dt>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>rolls outta bed and stretches, gets his gear and, with no words, heads straight to Agata's tent</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The camp is restless as the regulars, artillery and officers prepare to move out. About you men and women are packing equipment, loading carts and moving heavy boxes of weapons.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>arrives outside Agata's tent, stands up straight and awaits for the other arrivals</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  Liam says <q>Ba'Raknul is my character, a mysterious traveller from distant lands who possesses deadly skill with hand and weapons. His body is covered in ritualistic scars. He's currently the longest serving member of the party, and its unofficial leader.</q>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">hoarsely</span> Stop yelling at me.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>

  <p>Can’t say I didn’t warn you <span class="action">and carries on</dd></p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>gives single grunt of acknowledgement as Ba arrives but says nothing</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  Morgan says <q>The newest recruit, Orin is having trouble adjusting to their new environment. They still think of themself as a bowyer; the finest, in fact, in all the midlands.</q>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>Rolls out of bed still wearing their clothes and boots. They’re confused for a second but decide it's lucky since they don't have to get dressed. Stumbling out of their tent, they try to tuck in their shirt but somehow manage to only make it worse. They circle themself like a dog chasing its tail, trying to figure out what's gone wrong.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  Ric says <q>Corporal Loth is Agata's second-in-command. This tall, handsome man has never spoken a word as far as anyone in the camp can recall.</q>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Loth</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>ducks out of Agata's tent, giving Ba and Biron a suspicious eye</p>
  <p>nods his head, as though to ask what you want</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>

  <p>stumbles up behind Ba and Biron, wavering and blocking out the sunlight with an arm</p>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">nods</span> We're here to report to Agata.</p>
</dd>

<aside>
  Chris says <q>Biron is my Barbarian character. Hailing from the North, he speaks straight, plainly and bluntly if required, preferring to use body language to get his point across (i.e. his axe).</q>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>rolls his eyes when he sees Orin but still says nothing</p>
</dd>

<dt>Loth</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>rolls his eyes and opens the tent for you to enter</p>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">nods again</span> Thanks</p>
  <p class="action">enters</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  Morgan says <q>During their break, Orin spent their time trying to convince Agata to transfer them to the arms division and mourning River, the dog they were forced to leave behind in Dismas.</q>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Loth</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>gives Orin a look of absolute contempt as they pass, his eyes flickering as though he can see something dancing about them</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>grunts towards Corporal Loth and follows Ba, steps into Agata's tent and stands up straight and in military style in front of her desk</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>You enter the now familiar and slightly comforting gloomy and smoke filled interior of Agata's tent.</p>

<aside class="chat">
  Ric says <q>Sergeant Agata is the ageing and world-weary commander of the party. Nominally charged with hunting down deserters, Agata and her fetches now find themselves increasingly involved in the murky world of intrigue and espionage.</q>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Corporal Linus was dead before we even arrived.</p>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>He's dead?! How?</p>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>The smelly woman!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Stabbed to death by the Sparrow.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Ah, yes, the Sparrow...</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin:</dt>
<dd>
  <p>She wrote me a letter... <span class="action">pats their pockets looking for it, only to realise it was left in the tent</span></p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>starts sorting through her paperwork, before fishing out a piece of paper and handing it to Ba</p>

<dt>Agata</dt>

  <p>Take a look at the description of the three individuals in this warrant and tell me... do they remind you of anyone?</p>

  <p>Liam says <q>Is there a bounty?</q></p>
  <p>Ric says <q>Yes, a not inconsiderable one of 30gp for all three of you</q>.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>It is a warrant for high treason for three shady individuals and a dog... sound familiar?</p>

  <p>eyes widen at the "DOG"</p>

<dt>Orin</dt>

  <p>tries to hide a giggle behind their sleeve</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>River was a traitor</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Morgan says <q>When not pestering Agata, and often while pining after River, Orin was also investigating means of getting out of the Black Griffins. According to company law, you can buy your way out, but no one Orin spoke to has heard of anyone managing it.</q></p>

  <p>Ric says <q>There are no locked gates or guards keeping the mercenaries of the Griffin Company true to their contracts. All know that if they desert, fetches will be sent to arrest or kill them. And no one escapes the fetches.</q></p>

  <p>This is Rothaniel's nonsense.</p>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>What?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>He never believed us.</p>
  <p><span  class="action">turns back to Agata</span> We appealed to him for help but Ba insisted on secrecy. So he never believed who we are.</p>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I think you better start from the beginning and this better be good or I'll have you executed myself!</p>

<dd>
  <p>That silly piece of paper is the result.</p>

</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>He then asked for names of you and people in the camp so I said no... they were transporting us somewhere when the Commonwealth attacked and we escaped.</p>

  <p>Not before saving Rothaniel's life and letting him walk home alive</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Should have killed him.</p>

<dt>Orin</dt>

  <p>And he STILL thought we were traitors.</p>


<dt>Agata</dt>

  <p>And who exactly is Rothaniel?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>We should've shaved more than his moustache...</p>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Rothaniel, ‘King’s Finest Shot’ is how he introduced himself.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>YOU SHAVED HIS MUSTACHE?!?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>So as not to be recognised.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>turns red, not sure whether to laugh or run away</p>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>We had a while to travel with him as a captive to be sure we were safe.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>He didn't have to be a captive, only he refused to cooperate.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I had hoped he would help us escape the city and I was wrong. That is on me.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">rubs the bridge of her nose and sighs heavily</span> You don't make my job easy.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>He was going to execute us then and there if I hadn't talked him out of it. Instead he drove us into the forest to see someone else, when we were ambushed by the Commonwealth.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Yes they have a base in the forest somewhere, it’s very secretive.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>listening to his own story the others were saying rolls his own eyes and grunts a little in disbelief</p>

  <p>In the Kings Wood.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">picks up the warrant</span> Fortunately for you, I don't believe the three of you have the wits for high treason. I can handle this but... you need to tell me everything you know about the Sparrow.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>She was smelly, and also thought we were idiots... or at least too polite for our own good.</p>
</dt>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">turns to Orin</span> She may well be right on that score.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>They were masters of disguise... I thought at one point that Linus had turned on us but I never thought it was someone undercover.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Did any of you get a look at them out of disguise?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>cringes at the idea</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>They took full advantage of the lack of communication and organisation in our ranks. And no.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>It's rather your job to think on your feet in the field, and that's a shame. A physical description would set us all up for life.

The Royalists pay dearly for any information.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I will catch them.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I suspected them at first, but they always seemed to check out.

I won't make that mistake again.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">nods, smiling a little</span> More importantly, why did the Sparrow let you live?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>blushes</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Maybe she underestimates us.</p>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">snarls</span> Maybe she saw us as useless.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>

  <p>I thought the note suggested she took a liking to us. We were kind to one of her compatriots.</p>

  <p>Who we were sent to kill.</p>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sits back down, pulls out her pipe, lights it and puffs heavily as she ponders what you have to say</p>
  <p>It has come down from above from our... clients... that our focus should be on uncovering the Sparrow and her network of spies, <q>The Flock</q>.</p>
  <p>They have agents everywhere... probably even in this camp.</p>

  <p>snarls again</p>

<dt>Agata</dt>
<dd>
  <p>The Royalists would pay dearly for an alive agent they could interrogate... but it would be in our interests to interrogate any such individual ourselves, first.</p>

  <p>You understand?</p>

<dd>
  <p>Patrol the perimeter. You'll be sharing duties with another patrol. They'll be on day shift, you'll be on the night shift but... before you do that I need you to run an errand.</p>
  <p>There is a farm nearby, a family lives there. The Livelys. They provide us with fruit and vegetables but we haven't had a supply from them in a while.</p>
  <p>Life is dangerous for commoners this close to the frontlines. I want to make sure... they're OK.</p>

<h5>Scene II: Lively Farm</h5>

<p>You set off for the Livelys' farm, just as your compatriots set off for the great push. With grim determination, phalanxes of mercenaries march northward.</p>

<p>You wave goodbye as they pass and they wave back, uncertainly. Perhaps this will be the last you will see of many of them, you ponder as you enter the sparse woods and trek towards the farm.</p>

<p>The weather is grey, and turns into a light drizzle, not entirely unpleasant, cool even, especially for Orin.</p>

<p>As you near the farm it is lunch and you all feel a great hunger.</p>

<p>What do you do?</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">grunts</span> Are we there yet, I need to eat something.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba' Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">pauses a moment and scans around</span> Maybe we should break here... eat and continue more stealthily.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>gives the rest an embarrassed look, since they have been ploughing through rations while they walked</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba' Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">chuckles</span> You can keep watch then.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Sure.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>stops and starts to make camp</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">watches Biron</span> Probably not a good idea to light a fire, though?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>No we should stick to cold rations" as he sits down and starts eating.

We should only stay here an hour.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>searches the horizon for trouble</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>At most.. we still need to make it back for night watch duty.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>You break and eat a portion of your rations each, while Orin warily watches the dripping woods about you.</p>

<p>Nothing untoward happens until you finish your dry repast, when you hear a keen, high wailing in the distance, coming from the direction the farm lies in.</p>

<p>It stops almost as soon as it starts, but you all shudder as though it suddenly got colder.</p>

<p>What do you do?</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>jumps to his feet with his axe, sniffs the air, and stares into the blackness</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba' Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">stands again</span> Okay we should go stealthy from here. Orin if you wanna go ahead 30 feet. Tshrow your hand straight up if we're to stop or shout if its bad.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>That's highly coincidental. Do you think they saw us?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I don’t know.. but if they did or not.. it won’t serve us to rush in.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">snarls</span> Time to kill.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The two try to remain quiet, but Ba steps upon a stick by accident. The silence is broken and a startled flock of birds flies from a tree.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>soon comes upon the farm</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>All seems quiet.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>waits for Orin’s signal</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>There are very clear signs the farmhouse has been attacked. Walls are fallen and the barn is charred as though someone had tried to burn it down.</p>

<p>What do you do?</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>raises their hand for the others to stop</p>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>stares around for any movement</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>All is still except for the dripping of water from the trees above.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>moves quietly about 90 degrees around the farm, looking for details</p>
  <p>rolls a perception check: 5</p>
</dd>

<p>You see nothing untoward.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Let’s move in.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>climbs a tall tree to see further into the farm's premises.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>You get an impression of the internal layout of the farmhouse, and you can see the burned barn. Beyond seems to be some kind of ruins.</p>

<p>The door to the farmhouse appears to have been hacked to pieces.</p>

<p>What do you do?</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>walks back to the others and describes what they found</p>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">whispers</span> Hmm. Clearly an attack, but what of the wailing?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>steps out and moves towards the buildings</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Someone is clearly alive in there and in some distress. Or they know we're coming and it's a lure.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>nods in agreement</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>walks to the building where the sound came from and leans against the wall and listens</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Orin how do you feel about hiding in the tree there? <span class="action">points to the tree jutting out a bit</span> Good vantage point.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Vantage point for what, exactly?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Well if there’s no threat then no harm no foul... if there is threat then we can lead them into range... gives us an advantage."</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>calls out</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>And the two of you go in alone? Not that Biron's giving you much of a choice.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">looks over at Biron calling out</span> We'll get read then, I guess <span class="action">and unhooks his bow</span>.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>rushes quietly to the tree and climbs, knocking an arrow.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>As Biron approaches the farmhouse, he spies through the broken door a room that was once a kitchen. It is a a fright, furniture smashed to pieces, cooking utensils scattered everywhere.</p>

<p>Blood spatters the walls.</p>

<p>What does he do?</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>looks over to Ba and gestures with his head to follow</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>moves up on Biron, bow out and ready</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>raises axe and steps towards the crack and listens</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Silent as the grave, nothing stirs.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>We should move. Be quick, people maybe here.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Hence the idea of bait... however <span class="action">loads an arrow</span> we can do this your way if you want</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>smiles and nods</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>goes to front door and kicks door in hard and bursts in</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>follows keeping the 10ft distance and arrow ready</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Biron brushes away what little was left of the door and finds himself in what was once a family kitchen, now in disarray. Everything is broken, blood everywhere but... there are no bodies to be seen.</p>

<p>The only thing of note is a pot of soup that has spilled onto its side, spilling the thin gruel across the floor.</p>

<p>There are three other doors from this room.</p>

<p>What do you do?</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">whispers to Biron</span> On you.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>checks the soup</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>It is thin - clearly the Livelys were not doing well - and very cold. It must've been some time since it was cooked.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p>This happened a while ago.</p>
  <p><span class="action">steps to the first door on the left</span> You check one of the other doors</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>nods and moves to one of the other doors</p>

<dt>Biron</dt>

  <p>opens door with shield up and axe held high</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">
  <p>opens simultaneously and draws his arrow</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  Morgan says <q>I'm imagining some sort of slick crime drama walk through... I half expect Biron to shout 'Clear!'</q>
</aside>

<p>Biron’s door opens on what appears to be a pantry. Shelves filled with flour, pickles and various herbs. All strangely undisturbed... what kind of looters leave perfectly good food behind?</p><p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ba opens a door on what must’ve been a bedroom. This room is filled with sacks of wool and feathers all piled up on the floor. Clearly this is where the Livelys must've slept together in one big pile.</p>

<p>All is still and quiet.</p>

<aside>
  Ric says <q>There you go, Morgan! LOL.</q>

<p>Suddenly outside, Orin hears a rustling from the woods... all about them!</p>

<p>Prowling with deadly intent, wolves creep from the woods.</p>

<p>The alpha lets out a clear, mournful howl before the pack runs towards the house and the tree where Orin is!</p>
