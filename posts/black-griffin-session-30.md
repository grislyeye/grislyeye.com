<p>This is the first campaign diary for my playtest campaign, <strong>Black Griffin</strong>. Black Griffin is a play-by-chat game that runs every week on Roll20.</p>

<p>The below is an edited copy of our "in-character" chat channel. We've added annotations so you can follow what is going on. Please enjoy!</p>

  <p>After escaping the clutches of Royalist interrogators, our band of misfit fetches find their way back to Black Griffin camp and spend a week unwinding.</p>

  <p>However, as you relax the rest of the camp is gearing up. The Company's Royalist clients are gathering forces for a push against the Commonwealth.</p>

  <p>You awaken the next morn, ready to report to Agata for your debriefing.</p>
  </div>
  <aside>
  Sergeant Agata is the ageing and world-weary commander of the party. Nominally charged with hunting down deserters, Agata and her fetches now finds themselves increasingly involved in the murky world of intrigue and espionage.

  Biron is a Barbarian Northerner played by Chris. He speaks straight, plainly and bluntly if required, preferring to use body language to get his point across (i.e. his axe).
