<p>This is the first campaign diary for my playtest campaign, <strong>Black Griffin</strong>. Black Griffin is a play-by-chat game that runs every week on Roll20.</p>

<p>The below is an edited copy of our "in-character" chat channel. We've added annotations so you can follow what is going on. Please enjoy!</p>

<h4>Camp Patrol Act I</h4>

<aside class="chat">
  Ric (DM) says <q>Sergeant Agata is the ageing and world-weary commander of the party. Nominally charged with hunting down deserters, Agata and her fetches now finds themselves increasingly involved in the murky world of intrigue and espionage.</q>
</aside>

<p>After escaping the clutches of Royalist interrogators, our band of misfit fetches find their way back to the Black Griffin Encampment and spend a week unwinding.</p>

<p>However, as you relax the rest of the camp is gearing up. The Company's Royalist clients are gathering forces for a push against the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>You awaken the next morn, ready to report to Agata for your debriefing.</p>

  Chris says <q>Biron is my Barbarian Northerner. He speaks straight, plainly and bluntly if required, preferring to use body language to get his point across (i.e. his axe).</q>

<p>The camp is restless as the regulars, artillery and officers prepare to move out. About you men and women are packing equipment, loading carts and moving heavy boxes of weapons about.</p>
