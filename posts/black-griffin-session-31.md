<p>This is the second campaign diary for my 5th Edition D&amp;D playtest campaign, <strong>Black Griffin</strong>. Black Griffin is a play-by-chat game that runs every week on Roll20. The party are mercenaries in the employ of the infamous Company of the Black Griffin. Lowly even for sellswords, they have been placed on punishment duty as company <q>fetches</q>: bounty hunters charged with capture of deserters for trial.</p>

<p>The below is an edited log from of our <q>in-character</q> chat channel. We've added annotations so you can follow what's going on. Please enjoy!</p>

<h5>Scene II: Lively Farm (Continued)</h5>

<p>When we last left our nefarious band of fetches, they had investigated the Lively family's farm only to find it empty and in disarray.
As they investigated they were set upon by a pack of wolves brought out of the deep woods by the ensuing war and easy pickings of fresh meat.</p>

<p>We join them as the party defend themselves.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks up to the air and growls, readying his axe</p>
  <p>Listen, somethingâ€™s happening.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Baâ€™Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">pricks his ears up</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">steps out over the rubble of the tumbled down wall and readies himself</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Ric says <q>Everyone roll initiative please.</q></p>
  <p>Chris rolls 22 for Biron's initiative.</p>
  <p>Liam rolls 18 for Ba's initiative.</p>
  <p>Morgan rolls 12 for Orin's initiative.</p>
  <p>Morgan says <q>Nice.</q></p>
  <p>Chris says <q>Shawing.</q></p>
</aside>

<p>Biron spies a couple of wolves emerging from the trees, joined by another pair circling around the farm house.
They run toward him, snarling viciously.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Orin spies six more wolves moving towards the front of the house. Four start to tear at the front door and windows, sensing Ba within.
The other two jump and scratch at the base of the tree, eager to get at Orin's perch.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">snarls back at them</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Biron swipes as the wolves leap toward him, but it jumps out the way. Clearly they are well versed in avoiding axe blows!</p>

<aside>
  <p>Chris rolls 12 for Biron's attack roll. It's a miss!</p>
  <p>Ric says <q>Chris, please make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw for Biron.</q></p>
  <p>Chris rolls a 17 to avoid Biron being knocked prone by the wolfâ€™s bite.</p>
  <p>Chris says <q>Are these wolves acting the way normal wolves act? Or are they clearly trained?</q></p>
  <p>Ric says <q>Biron has encountered wolves before, and these act much as those others. They seem a good deal braver and less cautious though. Perhaps emboldened by stomachs fat off carrion.</q></p>
</aside>

<p>The pack seem particularly organised as they swarm around Biron. While one beast feints, another uses the distraction to bite deep into his forearms.
The other three creatures take the opportunity to pull at the flesh of Biron's arms and legs for a total of 22 piercing damage.</p>

<p>They attempt to pull Biron down so they can get at his more vulnerable spots but he pulls free from their bites and remains standing.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">roars in what seems like anger, the pain shredding through his body</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Meanwhile the wolves at the door - so to speak - are making short work of the brittle wood and Ba can already see the muzzles of the creatures snapping and chomping through breaks. Another round and they'll be through!</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sees the wolvesâ€™ maws baying at the door of the farmhouse and whistles out to them</p>
  <p>COME ON PUPS LETS PLAY!</p>
  <p class="action">Moves backwards towards Orin and then, focusing his ki, bursts strength into his legs. With two bounds he jumps to the roof of the house and then, loosing an arrow at one of wolves attacking Biron, leaps across to the barn roof.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Liam rolls 6 for Ba's attack. Itâ€™s a miss!</p>
  <p>Liam says <q>Ha ha ha all the jumping put his shot off.</q></p>
</aside>

<p>Such a graceful move is rewarded with a shot so close it catches some of the fur off one of the ravening beasts, but doesn't pierce it.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">shifts their bow and readied arrow to one hand, and climbs a little higher for safety. They then lean against the branch and release an arrow at the nastiest looking wolf at Biron's legs.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Morgan rolls 24 for Orin's attack roll and hits for 14 piercing damage.</p>
</aside>

<p>The arrow strikes the creature in the side, a heavy blow that sends it flying, landing it several feet away. It lies still on the ground.</p>

<aside>
  <p>Chris says, <q>I don't think anyone will blame me for getting higher ground hahaha. Four of these guys halved my health in one turn!</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>I'll allow you to jump onto the roof of the farmhouse, but its a DC 13 Athletics check</q></p>
  <p>Chris rolls 24 for Biron's Athletics check to jump onto the farmhouse roof.</p>
  <p>Chris says, <q>Awesome!</q></p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">With a blood curdling scream of anger, he reaches for his axe. But, looking over the wolves, Biron instead makes a mighty leap to the roof behind him.</p>
  <p class="action">With an evil smile he looks down at the dogs and pulls out a javelin, awaiting his next turn.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">seeing Bironâ€™s giant leap calls out</p>
  <p>You've got the makings of a monk in you! Now be careful guys, we can take them from here.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The wolves left behind aren't waiting around, they start jumping up at Biron.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">in a low, hushed growled voice</p>
  <p>Come get me, bitches.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>It's tricky on four paws, but they're surprisingly nimble and nearly make it. You might not be so lucky next time.</p>

<p>The four wolves at the front of the farmhouse break through the door and follow Ba to the barn. They eagerly collect beneath Ba's perch, jumping up to get at his warm flesh.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, two wolves are circling Orin's tree, snarling and looking at them with hungry eyes.</p>

<aside>
  <p>Liam says <q>How high up am I? Just so I know.</q></p>
  <p>Ric says <q>About 30 feet.</q></p>
  <p>Liam rolls a 19 for Ba's attack roll and hits for 4 piercing damage.</p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">reaches into his backpack and pulls out a flask of oil</p>
  <p>He sets it down and holds it with his foot then looses an arrow at one of the wolves trying to get at Biron.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Ba'Raknul catches a creature with an arrow in the hind quarters. Its whimpers are very gratifying.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">calls out</span> Orin! Got any fire?</p>
  <p class="action">motions to the bottle of oil perched over the baying wolves</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Morgan says, <q>Do I have line-of-sight on any of the wolves near Biron?</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Yes!</q></p>
  <p>Morgan rolls a 23 for Orin's attack roll and hits for 15 piercing damage.</p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">not registering Baâ€™s request over the adrenaline pumping through their veins, they draw another arrow and shoot at the biggest wolf jumping at Biron.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>This arrow strikes a wolf right in its maw, sending it flying and embedding its head in the ground.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">laughs and shouts</span> If you two don't do something soon, you'll get rather far behind!</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Chris says, <q>I'm holding an action to shove the wolf down, which ever one makes it up. I'm just gonna use my shield, that's just for flare! ðŸ˜„</q></p>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Make an Athletics check for Biron, please.</q></p>
  <p>Chris rolls a 25 for Biron's Athletics check to shove the wolf off the roof.</p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sees the two dead wolves on the floor and smiles, puts the javelin away, and then moves to hold his shield with two hands while waiting for next wolf to jump</p>
  <p class="action">roars as the wolf steps and slams his shield into the face of the wolf to throw him back down</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The creature goes flying, landing painfully on its side, but it's soon back up on its feet snarling and jumping to get at Biron again.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">gives a throaty laugh</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Ric says, <q>Ba's turn, but any ranged attacks or Dexterity checks are at disadvantage as the barn shakes.</q></p>
  <p>Liam says, <q>Ok.</q></p>
</aside>

<p>Meanwhile, the wolves at the base of Ba's perch have discovered that the barn isn't as solid as it looks. They are busy digging at the foundations and pulling at the loose boards.</p>

<p>The barn is beginning to shake fearfully!</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">seeing that Orin will not be providing the fire he looks down at the wolves, gets a torch, lights it and then one after another drops the flask slowly followed by the torch then moves to the other side of the structure.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The oil lights up the grass under a wolf, causing its under-carriage to catch fire. All four of the creatures stop what their doing and leap away, clearly fearful of the blaze!</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">sees the wolves react to the fire</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Morgan rolls 16 for Orin's attack roll and hits for 15 piercing damage.</p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">nocks another arrow and, grinning, shoots it at the healthier of Biron's two wolves</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>This time the arrow slashes the creatureâ€™s bowels, sending guts onto the ground. The creature runs off into the woods, presumably to die alone.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks at Orin and gives a single nod, then grunts</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">laughs</span> Orin, you're on fire.... GET IT!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Whoops! Fish in a barrel!</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Chris rolls for Biron's attack roll and hits for 9 piercing damage.</p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">picks up a javelin and hurls it at the wolf that he threw off the roof</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The javelin smashes the creature in the chest, sending ribs and blood flying!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, you all notice that the barn itself has caught light and is now ablaze! The fire appears to be worrying the wolves and as one they turn tail and disappear into the woods.</p>

<aside>Ric says <q>This is what you call 'raising the stakes.'</q> ðŸ˜œ</aside>

<p>Then you hear a scream from within the barn; someone is inside!</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks up at the noise</p>
  <p>Ba! Someone's inside!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">shouts to the group</span> Deal with the fire... I'll find them.</p>
  <p>He then rushes to the nearest hole or soft point in the roof and dives through.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Ba finds himself in the smoky interior of the burning barn. It's difficult to see anything at all.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">looks around calling out</span> HELLO, COME TO ME IF YOU CAN!</p>
  <p>He pulls his banana up to cover his face from smoke.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Ba stumbles about in the barn, but the black smoke is becoming impenetrable. You hear what sounds like coughing coming from somewhere in the rear of the barn but cannot say exactly where.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">heads in that direction best he can</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Meanwhile, outsideâ€¦</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">grunts and looks at the fire</p>
  <p class="action">jumps down and runs to the fire, looking for a way to quench it</p>
  <p><span class="action">calls to Orin</span> Help Ba! I donâ€™t know what to do with the fire.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">swings out of the tree and dashes to the far side of the building, looking for another door</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>They find a small door at the rear of the barn, on the side farthest from the farmhouse.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">swings it open and shouts</span> Come to my voice! There's a way out, here!</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Before Orin lies a small, unconscious form lying in the straw. It seems impossibly pale in the black smoke, almost entirely naked. There is something not quite right about the way itâ€™s lying down.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">grabs the form and drags it 15ft out of the barn</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>â€‹Liam rolls 11 to pass a Constitution save against smoke inhalation for Ba.</p>
</aside>

<p>Ba finally finds his way to the same area of the barn, drawn by the light from outside.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">runs around the building trying to hear where people are, axe ready if needed</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The form at Orinâ€™s feet appears to be the body of a boy, no more than 11 or 12 summers. Nearly unconscious, you can see why he looked odd: he's missing his right arm! It has been cut clean off at the shoulder, with almost butcher-like precision.</p>

<p>He coughs black smoke into the clear air, gulping fresh air down.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks at the kid suspiciously and then turns to the burning barn</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">runs up and scoops up the child</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The boy is unconcious. In all your years on the battlefield you've not seen so precise a cut, even from many veteran surgeons. He needs to be taken to a physician soon.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Biron do we think we can knock the burning bit down and away so the rest doesnâ€™t go up, or is it too late?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks at the building again</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The barn is now completely alight, the roasting hot air beating against your brows.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">grunts, visibly looking like he wants to go and fight the fire, but unsure how
Itâ€™s most of the south half now. I canâ€™t do that much.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">pulls their spare shirt from their bag and makes a bandage from the whole thing</p>
  <p>Do you think there are any medics left at camp?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p>If there arenâ€™t any we can watch him... but Agata knew these people, she'll want to know.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Let's get him to the house and clean him up, see if we can get some water in him, then?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">looks around</span> If we can get some sticks and a jacket or something, we can make a stretcher to keep him better protected.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">grunts disapprovingly but nods</p>
  <p class="action">walks up to the edge and listens to the wood around him, keeping an eye out for movement</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The woods seems still, a breeze blows across the grass beyond. You see what looks like the foundations of what was once a tower and... something glints in the grass beyond. Something metal.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">snarls</span> On guard!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">snaps his head up and moves his hand to his longbow</p>
  <p>What is it?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">draws his might battleaxe</p>
  <p>Orin, keep eye on me.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">nods</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">crouches low but moves forwards quickly to the glint of metal, axe ready to swing at any given person</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">knocks an arrow, waiting</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>As you approach, you see blood is splattered about the grass but otherwise there is no sign of life. You see there is a weapon lying in the long grass, a longsword made of strange metal, black as though caked in soot. A metal that looks... familiar.</p>

<p>The blade itself is strange, crudely forged yet impossibly sharp. It bears a sigil on the hilt: a half-lidded eye.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">narls and stares into the wood, looks for signs of figures that moved through here

  <p class="action">peers at the etching on the sword, wondering what it means</p>

<p>As Orin brings the sword closer they hear a strange sound, like a low hum that seems come from inside their head! They recoil slightly.</p>

<p>You make your way through the dark woods back to camp, leaving the burning pyre of the Lively's farm behind you. The woods seem a good deal more sinister than on your trip here. You hear the sound of wolves howling in the distance as dusk falls!</p>

<h5>Scene III: The Infirmary</h5>

<p>The group makes it back to camp by nightfall and are waved through by the mercenaries on guard at the North Gate. They quickly make their way to the infirmary, which is manned this evening by Vicmas.</p>

  <p>Chris rolls 9 for Biron's Intimidation check to bully the physician to help.</p>

  <p>Ric says, <q>I'm never sure whether to call for an Intimidation check in these situations. It inevitably leads to the NPC becoming hostile and the interraction hitting a brick wall.</q></p>
