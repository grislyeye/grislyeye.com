<h5>Scene VIII: The Interrogation Continued...</h5>

<dl></dl>

<p>When we last left our collection of curmudgeonly crooks, they had learned of a meeting of spies and turncoats: a mysterious game of cards played at midnight.</p>

<p>There was a high toll to learn this information, and we join Biron and Willem as they emerge from the foul cellars-turned-oubliette of Captain Larke's manor house.</p>

<p>After the gloom of the cellars, it seems incredible to you that it is daylight outside, and you both blink in the sunlight.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">storms out, striding forward with his axe in hand.</dd>

<dt>Willem</dt>
<dd class="action">pulls the brim of his hat down, squinting against the light as he looks around for Biron, or for the expected trail of wreckage that might lead them to him.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">roars loudly, picking up some old wooden barrel and hurling it as far as he could with a roar of ridiculous anger. He seems oblivious to anyone around him.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Several startled mercenaries turn around, hands on the pommels of their swords. When they see it is Biron, they relax and carry on: this isn't the first northmen tantrum they've witnessed</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd class="action">makes his way out of the manor, wincing as the light hits his eyes.. He looks around and see's whats going on, gives Willem a quick nod and then sprints off to find Helia.</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Morgan rolled a 10 for Orin's Persuasion check.</p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">continues this reckless assault on inanimate objects. He eventually drops to a knee panting and furious. hand clenched across the top of his axe blade.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Willem is astounded by Biron's capacity for destruction.</p>

<p>What does he do now that Biron has ceased?</p>

<dl>
<dt>Willem</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">rolls his eyes and gives a halfhearted grumble under his breath as his commanding officer sprints away, then turns to raise a hand, a broad if nervous smile on his face.  “Easy feller…”  He looks around at the strewn wreckage.  “An are ye bein’ done with all that yet?”</p>
  <p>Happy to lend a hand, iff'n you're not.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">eyes suddenly dart up in furry and goes to grab Willem.</p>
  <p class="action">stares at Willem. For a moment unsure weather to attack or not. A moment passes with nothing happening. still with his hand clamped around Willems clothes. But then just pushes him away.</p>
  <p><span class="action">growls</span> Not you.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Willem</dt>
<dd>Yeah, yeah I get that a lot."  He tugs his coat back into place over his mail.  "But yer stuck with me, aren't ya?"  A sniff, and he cranes his neck to look around the camp.  "So what are we to do now while we wait on Helia?  Couldn't we be breaking somewhat's useful to us?  Wine casks or the like?</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd><span class="action">gives a low based growl.</span> Your point?</dd>

<dt>Willem</dt>
<dd><span class="action">barks a quick laugh. </span> Wasn't no point.  I'm askin'.  If we're gonna be smashin' up our camp, why'nt we at least smashin the bits with the wine?</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">huffs at Willem and turns to look at the house.</p>
  <p>"not the thing to break"</p>
  <p class="action">stands  slightly with his axe held tightly.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Willem</dt>
<dd><span class="action">sighs deeply and moves to plant his halberd in the dirt and lean against it. </span> Never no feckin wine in this feckin outfit.  All right, I hear ya.  An what's the play to be, then?</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">snarls and gives Willem a sharp look.</p>
  <p class="action">stays silent a moment and looks back at the house.</p>
  <p>"They should die"</p>
  <p>Traitorous, honorless slugs.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Willem</dt>
<dd>Oi."  Willem glares back.  "Don't with the growls.  Not at me.  I'm sayin'.  What's it to be now?  You've a hand'f soldiers besides ye, how should we be bringin' about those untimely demises?"</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd><span class="action">keeps his eyes fixed on the house.</span> They should burn. All traitors burn.</dd>

<dt>Willem</dt>
<dd><span class="action">nods slowly.  "Right then.  Burnin' it is."  He follows Biron's gaze. </span> You usually make the plans here, or should we be askin' Ba for how to bring the burnin' to 'em?</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks between the house and Willem. Clearly not having a plan and getting frustrated at the questions. Biron turns now to face Willem.</p>
  <p>"Why are you even here"</p>
  <p class="action">growls.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Sergeant-Bailiff Helia</dt>
<dd>If anyone'll be burning   traitors, it'll be I.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">glances up at this comment. a little bit surprised but no less angry.</dd>
</dl>

<p>You are suprised by the sound Helia's voice, and you turn around to see the stern northerner accompanied by her surly bailiffs and Ba'Raknul, here to collect her dues.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Willem</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks away from the house to wave a lazy hand at the remnants of barrels.</p>
  <p>Jes insurin' what ye don't break nothin' what comes back ter the resta...</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Meanwhile, Quinn and Orin emerge from the scullery door of Larke's manor house, dragging Eggard between them.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Corporal Eggard</dt>
<dd>Where are you taking me?</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>We don't break our promises, Eggard.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">scratches at a spot on his chin</span> Takin' ya somwhere where ya can take ya self I be thinkin'. But that would be up to my friend here, o'course.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">holds Eggard's pack tightly in their opposite hand.</dd>

<dt>Corporal Eggard</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks from Quinn to Orin, searching for the lie in their faces.</p>
  <p>You're joking?</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>You're actually going to let me go?</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">looks for anyone dangerous to their plan in the area.</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Morgan rolled a 23 for Orin's Perception check.</p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>''No, joke none. Folk of honour us. That's what ya was promised. In fact, we aint none to turn ya out without the means of survival...'</dd>

<dt>Corporal Eggard</dt>
<dd>Means of... survival?</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">subtly winks to Orin then turns back to Eggard.</p>
  <p>Here, take some coin - so ya can buy some food when you find an outpost or village.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">reappraises Quinn after seeing this generousity.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Orin furiously scans the crowds of milling company men and women... so far seems all clear.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">holds Eggard tight and moves for the nearest gate.</dd>

<dt>Corporal Eggard</dt>
<dd class="action">eagerly takes the coins, tears forming in his eyes at the generosity.</dd>
</dl>

<p>He seems completely speechless.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Let's go.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">nods and pushes Eggard gently forward.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">whispers:</p>
  <p>Slowly.</p>
  <p>We're being followed.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">stops and bends to adjust his boots, subtly looks behind him as he does so.</dd>
</dl>

<p>You spot a man, head completely hairless, sporting several elaborate piercings, rings and chains about his ears, trying to appear nonchalant.</p>

<p>He is clearly following you though.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">still whispering:</p>
  <p>Can we lose him in the tents?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stands and continues to walk, whispering in reply.</p>
  <p>Could try, or do you want me to block his path, delay him some while you take our friend here beyond the perimeter some?</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>You find yourselves now at  the row of  tents housing traders, catamites, and purveyors of dubious foods, that leads to the South Gate exit to the camp.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Here. Let's duck into a trader's tend and slip under the back wall.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">nods</span> Aye, if not, I may be able to cause a distraction like...</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>That could work.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">whisper</span> Yeah... you go on some... I'll try to hold him up.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">leads Eggard to the trader's tent.</p>
  <p>Eggard. No funny business. We may have set you free, but that just makes you a traitor to them. You want to get home in one piece, don't you?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Corporal Eggard</dt>
<dd class="action">nods mutely.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">pretends to be looking at an item near the front of the tent.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">clears his throat, adjusts his trews slightly and heads with feigned confidence back the way they came towards the bald stranger.</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Morgan rolled a 24 for Orin's Stealth check.</p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">as he approaches he grins and nods slightly at the man</span> Scuse me guvner - don't spose ya could change some coin could ya?</p>
  <p class="action">fumbles around in his purse.</p>
</dd>

<dt>The mercenary</dt>
<dd class="action">licks his lips, pauses a moment, then goes for his sword.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">seeing Quinn has engaged the stranger, they duck out of the tent and run into the tents on the way to the South Gate.</dd>
</dl>

<dl></dl>

<p>Quinn gets the draw on the pierced mercenary. What does he do?</p>

<dl>
<dt>The mercenary</dt>
<dd>FOR THE FOLK!</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">stops up short of the man, seeing him reach for his sword and quickly pulls his bow.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">mutters</span> Ye ain't coming closer guv'nor.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Your arrow strikes the pierced mercenary in the left shoulder, knocking him back slightly. Unfortunately, he seems un-fazed by your menacing attack and proceeds to draw his sword and approach you.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">backs off 30 foot.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Clearly the man is right-handed, unfortunately.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>This way, Eggard. Use the tents for cover.</p>
  <p class="action">ducks into the tents out of the man's line of sight.</p>
  <p class="action">guides Eggard further toward the South Gate as swift as they can.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>With Eggard in tow, Orin weaves between the camp follower tents and makes it to the end of the row. The gate is just 30 feet away.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the pierced mercenary dives behind the wagon of the apple trader, pulls out a rather large and lethal looking crowsbow and aims it at Quinn.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">screams</span> I didn't mean nuffin' by it!</dd>
</dl>

<p>A bolt shoots and lands at your feet Quinn, burying itself in the hard soil up to the feathers. You dread to think what it would've done if it had hit your body!</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">curses and returns fire.</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Mark rolled a 13 for Quinn Wheatsteal's Longbow check.</p>

<dl></dl>

<p>Your longbow shoots true, but hits the wood of the cart the mercenary is hiding behind. He gets a face full of wood splinters, but is otherwise unharmed.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">moves back to crouch behind a wagon, peering round and readying himself for the mercaneries next move.</p>
  <p>(back another 30ft if there's space - so around 65ft away or so)</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">stands up tall.</p>
  <p>Act normal.</p>
  <p class="action">walks to the gate and out to the left behind the wall.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Morgan rolled a 15 for Orin's Deception check.</p>
</aside>

<dl></dl>

<p>The pierced mercenary is too preoccupied to notice you as you causally saunter to the gate. You find yourselves standing outside the camp, the blasted waste of the Front spread out before you.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>This is it, Eggard.</p>
  <p>I have to go help my friend.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Corporal Eggard</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">seems to pause a moment, looking back into the camp with what seems to be longing... almost as though he was being dragged back by... something.</p>
  <p class="action">turns to Orin.</p>
  <p>Come with me! Fuck the three kings, and fuck this war!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Believe me, I'm thinking about it. But I'm not ready for that yet. I don't know how to live on the lamb. You've got your writ, but not me.</dd>

<dt>Corporal Eggard</dt>
<dd class="action">nods, and then runs off.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Run!</dd>

<dt>Corporal Eggard</dt>
<dd>They'll win, you know!</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">shrugs.</dd>
</dl>

<p>And with that he's gone.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">grins slyly before turning and running back to Quinn.</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Morgan rolled a 12 for Orin's Stealth check.</p>
</aside>

<dl></dl>

<p>Meanwhile, camp followers are scattering and screaming as they notice the bolts and arrows flying about their heads.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">shouts</span> Don't mind us, none!</dd>

<dt>The mercenary</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">moves closer, darting between running camp followers and ducks behind a pile of crates closer to Quinn's position.</p>
  <p>From his hiding place he fires another bolt at Quinn's head.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Willem</dt>
<dd class="action">looks wide-eyed from Ba to Helia, then to the sounds of the screams.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Quinn is too well covered, and the bolt harmlessly shatters the wheel of the wagon you're hiding behind.</p>

<p>*he's</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">draws and looses another hopeful arrow.</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Mark rolled a 23 for Quinn Wheatsteal's Longbow check.</p>
</aside>

<dl></dl>

<p>The arrow strikes the pierced traitor in the right shoulder this time, sending him spinning.</p>

<dl>
<dt>The mercenary</dt>
<dd>Shit, shit!</dd>
</dl>

<p>He's clearly very afeared of your fine arim.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">crouches back behind the wagon.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">slides between tents, positioning themself so that the commonwealth spy is clear in their view.</p>
  <p class="action">jumps out, arrow knocked and shoots, shouting...</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
  <p>Morgan rolled a 16 for Orin's Shortbow check.</p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>COMMONWEALTH TRAITOR!</dd>
</dl>

<p>Your arrow strikes true, hitting the traitor in the side of his face, sending shattered pieces of gold chains and rings of his piercings flying, as well as his jaw.</p>

<p>He slumps to the ground, dead.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">breathes heavily.</p>
  <p>Thank the father.</p>
  <p>Quinn help me drag him back to the manor.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">staggers to his feet and runs his hand under his running nose</span> Aye aye, will do...</p>
  <p class="action">mutters.</p>
  <p>Best pick up these jewels and stuff first though right? Don't want 'em getting lost none.</p>
  <p class="action">scrabbles about the floor picking up the chains and rings.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">shrugs.</p>
  <p>Why not. See if he's got anything problematic on him while you're looking.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">looks up as he does so</span> Hates to say it, but I reckons it best this be split among the men - let em know some that theres wealth in loyalty - if ya takes my meaning some.</p>
  <p><span class="action">nods</span> Aye, will do.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>I don't give a damn about loyalty or gold. Do what you like.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">shrugs</span> ... ain't like no-one will be squealing about this as we speak anyway I figure.</dd>
</dl>

<p>You collect what looks like about two gold pieces worth of shattered gold rings and chain piercings.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">stuffs em in one grubby pocket and goes and takes the man's legs.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">grabs the shoulders and leads them toward the manor.</dd>
</dl>

<p>It is not an unusual sight to see dead bodies being carried through the camp, so you barely get a second glance before you arrive at Larke's House just a second before Helia and Ba'Raknul show up.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Sergeant-Bailiff Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">turns to Quinn and Orin.</p>
  <p>Corporal Ba'Raknul, what is this?</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>*seconds after</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>

<dd><span class="action">mutters closing his eyes momentarilly</span> Mother watch over you, let your spirit depart your sins with your flesh.</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>

  <p>I dont know who he is.... Orin who is he?</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">growls in the background.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>You mean chasing Corporal Eggard, Ba? Off the traitor's tip he'd be escaping?</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">glaring at Ba, Orin and Quinn.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>This one got in our way and stopped us from catching him.</dd>

<dt>Sergeant-Bailiff Helia</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">shrugs.</p>
  <p>Eggard won't get far.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks in shock to play along.</p>
  <p>He escaped? which way did he go.. and where did this one come from.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>

  <p>Don't fret ye none - we're fine.</p>

<dt>Sergeant-Bailiff Helia</dt>
<dd class="action">nods to two of her large, adult bailiffs who run off towards the South Gate.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">looks at Quinn like he is about ready to plant his axe deep into him.</dd>

<dt>Willem</dt>
<dd class="action">shifts to stand between Biron and Quinn, shaking his head with a resigned expression and fixing Quinn with a roll of the eyes.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Pardon us, Sergeant. We're all very shocked by catching these traitors. And four, now. Not just three!</dd>

<dt>Sergeant-Bailiff Helia</dt>
<dd class="action">looks between the five of you, warily, pushing her weight from one crutch to t;other.</dd>

<dt>Willem</dt>
<dd>"Who's the new stiff?"</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">growling at Willem, takes a step towards him. but not saying anything.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">shakes one leg of the corpse</span> This one stopped us giving chase, so he did - then drew his blade on me! Was only my friend Orin saving me skin or it would be old Quinn being carried about stiff like. If ye take me meaning some.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Those two downstairs, the puffy-eyed one confessed to your business in Dismas. Said the third was stealing away in the night.</p>
  <p>Quinn and I... we almost caught him!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Sergeant-Bailiff Helia</dt>
<dd class="action">raises a hand to stay you.</dd>

<dt>Willem</dt>
<dd>Ye can beat him bloody later," he leans in to whisper to Biron, though not so low that all present can't easily hear it, "just not when the officers is about like.</dd>

<dt>Sergeant-Bailiff Helia</dt>
<dd>I don't know what's really going on, and to be honest, I don't care. As long as I get some traitors.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Bring 'em out.</p>

<dt>Biron</dt>

  <p>That was the plan Biron.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>I also set him up to get caught again immediately and burned a traitor, Biron.</dd>

<dt>Willem</dt>
<dd>Yeah who's the new body?  How'd you suss him ut?</dd>
