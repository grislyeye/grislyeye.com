<p>These variant, character creation rules are for low magic campaigns where spellcasters and monsters are uncommon and non-human characters with magical abilities are the exception, not the rule.</p>

<p>Normally, low-magic characters are limited to playing *humans*, and choosing from the following classes only:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Path of Berserker Barbarian</li>
  <li>Battle Master <em>or</em> Champion Fighter</li>
  <li>Thief <em>or</em> Assassin Rogue</li>
</ul>

<h3>Unique Backgrounds</h3>

<p>If you want to play a magical character you can select a unique background at the start of character creation, instead of a normal background. A unique background represents a rare or special origin that might give your character access to magical races or classes (or feats) in a way that is sympathetic to low-magic campaigns.</p>

<p>Each unique background lists which magical races, classes and feats are available to players who choose them.</p>

<p>Unique backgrounds have the following limitations:</p>

<ol>

  <li><strong>Unique.</strong> You may only pick a particular unique background if no one else in your party has chosen it.</li>

  <li><strong>No Feature.</strong> You do not gain a background feature with a unique background.</li>

  <li><strong>Unique Flaw.</strong> In addition to the flaw you would normally choose for your character, you must choose an extra, unique flaw detailed in the description of your unique background.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Example: Far Traveller</h3>

<p>This section takes the far traveller background from the <em>Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide</em> and shows how you can adapt it into a unique background. Follow the far traveller background as written, with these changes:</p>

</div>

<p>The unique far traveller represents a character that hails from distant lands where magic yet lingers, strange arts are practiced and mysterious gods still make their presence known.</p>

<p>You do not gain the All Eyes On You feature if you take far traveller as a unique background. Instead, you must take the Strange Custom unique flaw, as described below.</p>

<p>You may now choose from the following options at character creation:</p>

<p><strong>Classes:</strong> Cleric, Monk, Path of Totem Warrior Barbarian, Sorcerer, Warlock or Wizard.</p>

<h4>Unique Flaw: Strange Customs</h4>

<p>In order to use your mysterious magics, or commune with your strange gods, you must perform curious customs or rituals, often at inconvenient moments. You can roll on the following table to determine your custom, or choose one that best fits your homeland.</p>
